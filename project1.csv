The analysis of variants related to DMKU3 and between haplotypes shows changes in LAC12 and INU1, which we hypothesize can impact carbon source performance. This report presents the first polyploid K. marxianus strain recovered from nonlactic fermenting medium., The yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus is emerging as a remarkable alternative for fermentation processes, metabolic engineering, omics analysis, and recombinant protein production, having several advantages over other yeasts. These include the ability to metabolize a wide variety of sugars, such as glucose, fructose, fructans, xylose, and lactose, which are abundant sugars in nature (i.e., agave juice, lignocellulosic biomass, whey, and molasses) (Fonseca et al. 2008; Lane and Morrissey 2010; Amaya-Delgado et al. 2013; Flores et al. 2013; Schabort et al. 2018)., K. marxianus is thermotolerant and shows rapid cellular growth even when cultured with growth-inhibitor molecules (Li et al. 2018; Flores-Cosío et al. 2019). Previous studies of this yeast highlighted the significant physiological variation amongst K. marxianus strains in terms of their fermentation characteristics and ability to use various substrates, suggesting genetic diversity within the species (Flores et al. 2013; Ortiz-Merino et al. 2018)., Our strain, K. marxianus NRRL Y-50883 (SLP1), was isolated from hostile fermentation musts during the mezcal fermentation process in San Luis Potosí, México, and belongs to the yeast collection of the Centro de Investigación y Asistencia en Tecnología y Diseño del Estado de Jalisco (CIATEJ, A.C). K. marxianus SLP1 is a strain with interesting characteristics because it produces ethanol from mixtures of glucose–xylose, and agave fructans and fructose, while producing several industry-desirable metabolites such as fructanases, aromatic compounds, and higher alcohols (Flores et al. 2013; Flores-Cosío et al. 2018)., Compared to other yeasts, SLP1 produces a significant amount of ethanol, derived from different lignocellulosic hydrolysates and agave juice for tequila production (Flores et al. 2013; Sandoval-Nuñez et al. 2018; Alcazar-Valle et al. 2019). SLP1 can tolerate high concentrations of organic acids, furans, phenols, oxidant agents, and saponins, which are considered growth inhibitors, as well as high temperatures. This outstanding tolerance is related to the physiological ability of SLP1 to change the cell membrane composition to increase its robustness under unfavorable fermentation conditions (Arellano-Plaza et al. 2013; Alcázar et al. 2017; Mejía-Barajas et al. 2017, 2018; Flores-Cosío et al. 2019)., To understand the genomic differences of K. marxianus SLP1 and other strains of this species that can be isolated, for example, from dairy products, it is important to know the genetic features that provide thermotolerance, sugar transporter, and other traits that confer the most significant qualities of SLP1. Ortiz-Merino et al. (2018) showed divergence in K. marxianus UFS-Y2791 isolated from Agave Americana compared to K. marxianus isolated from dairy products. This opens the question as to what extent K. marxianus genomic variability is associated with nondairy strains., Here, we report the whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation results of K. marxianus SLP1, which allow the identification of the genomic machinery available in this strain as a product of the adaptive response to a stress phenomenon and the evaluation of its impact on this mechanism through gene identification, enrichment by ontology, and variant classification. The results of this work allow us to study the dynamics of adaptation and provide knowledge on nonlactic K. marxianus that show diploidy., The yeast K. marxianus (NRRL Y-50883) was grown overnight at 30°C at 250 rpm in 50 mL of YPD medium to the early stationary phase before cells were harvested by centrifugation. Total genomic DNA was extracted using the Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit Technical Manual according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quality was verified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, Delaware, USA) and verifying its integrity in agarose gel., The sequencing was performed by Macrogen Inc, Korea. Whole-genome de novo sequencing was performed by PacBio using a SMRT Cell 8Pac V3 with DNA Polymerase Binding Kit P6 and DNA Sequencing Reagent 4.0 v2. The reads were processed by the parallel statistical analysis of the k-mer spectrum in sequencing Jellyfish data (Marçais and Kingsford 2011), which counts the occurrence of all 21-mer length fragments. Once the raw data were processed, they were moved to GenomeScope 2.0, a reference-free analyzer used to establish genome profiling (Ranallo-Benavidez et al. 2020). PacBio performed exploration with both tools, and generated outputs estimates for size, repetitiveness, and polyploid (through heterozygosity rate)., K. marxianus SLP1 raw reads were assembled using Falcon software via Bioconda (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-assembly). The first Falcon module was run in three steps: (1) overlap detection and error correction of raw reads, (2) overlap detection of corrected reads, and (3) string graph assembly. Following, to extract haplotig fragments, we ran the Falcon-Unzip package with the previously generated data. The two main stages for the latter were: (1) identifying SNPs and assigning phases and (2) assembling the graph annotation with the phases. Falcon-Unzip was run with the parameters adjusted for yeast sequences. After, we generated two types of fasta files: primary contigs and haplotigs. Primary contigs are the longest continuous stretches of contiguously assembled sequences, and haplotigs are contigs from a specific haplotype (Chin et al. 2016)., The assembly quality was assessed using the QUAST 5.1 (https://github.com/ablab/quast) algorithm. We calculated basic metrics (L50, N50, and number of sequences, amongst others) and included NG50 and L50 using a reference genome K. marxianus DMKU3 (K. marxianus GCA_001417885.1). The genome completeness was determined using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) software v4.1.4 with the Saccharomycetes ortholog gene set from OrthoDB in terms of found single-copy orthologs in the genome by researching the absence or presence of highly conserved genes, which are reported as complete if the length is two standard deviations of BUSCO groups, duplicated if a complete gene is found with more than one copy, fragmented if is partially recovered, and missing if is not recovered (Simão et al. 2015)., We also aligned the contigs with the reference genome to find structural variants with the MUMmer package nucmer. Sequences were aligned with MUMmer 3.23 using a reference genome (K. marxianus DMKU3-1043 with genome assembly identifier: GCA_001417885.1), and by calling the SNP positions, the output file was converted to a VCF file. Next, variant annotation was analyzed by SNPeff 5.0 using the public DMKU3-1042 genome annotation as a reference. In addition, we aligned the amino acid sequences of the SLP1 alleles to two genes using the InterProScan web service (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/): LAC12 with strain CBS 397 for its efficient lactose consumption, and INU1 with strain DMKU3 for sequence similarity., We separated the K. marxianus SLP1 diploid genome into haplotypes to identify both sub-genomes. After the assembly, we assigned primary contigs as haplotype A. Then, we designed a Python (3.8) script that takes the coordinate data of each haplotig produced by Falcon, replacing the sequences in the primary contig to generate the haplotype B., Gene prediction and annotation were conducted in both haplotypes with Funannotate pipeline v. 1.7.0 (Palmer 2016), which includes softmasking with RepeatMasking and RepeatModeler tools, an ab initio gene predictor (Augustus, snap, glimmerHMM, codingQuary, and GenMark), and functional annotation of the protein-coding genes. Then, we assessed the ontology enrichment of genes categorized by the PANTHER web server (http://pantherdb.org/) into the three main ontologies: molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. An NJ phylogenetic tree was generated with CLC Sequence Viewer 8.0 to establish taxonomic distance using the K. marxianus SLP1 fatty acid synthase subunit beta (FAS1) gene. The FAS1 gene is present during different stress responses, considered a wide-range fermentative yeasts taxonomic marker (Roscini et al. 2020) and was proven to be essential in the adaptive evolution of K. marxianus., Sequencing was performed on the PacBio RS System using Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT), generating 82,360 reads with an average length 10,384 bp for a total length of >855 Mb with N50 = 16,868 b., Pacbio reads showed a high heterozygosity rate, consistent with our previous analysis of K. marxinus SLP1 k-mer frequency in sequencing data produced by the Illumina platform (data not shown). Figure 1 shows the k-mer profile results from GenomeScope. There are two major peaks between ∼30 and 55. The first peak is higher than the second; this is an indicator of high heterozygosity. This evidence is consistent with the findings of a diploid genome (Ranallo-Benavidez et al. 2020). The size estimation obtained by GenomeScope is 11.9 Mb, with a uniqueness of 88.33% and heterozygosity of 3.27%. After k-mer profile analysis, 70× coverage of the estimated 11.9 Mb K. marxianus SLP1 genome was calculated., k-mer frequency of PacBio raw reads. Plot obtained by GenomeScope using k = 21.

The fit of the GenomeScope model (black line) and the k-mer frequencies observed (blue area)., The K. marxianus SLP1 diploid genome was assembled into 32 primary contigs covering 12.04 Mb with N50 = 1.3 Mb and L50 = 4, with the same values for NG50 and LG50. We also identified 38 haplotigs covering 955,365bp with N50 = 368,823bp, NG50 = 361, 944 bp, and L50 = 9, with the same value for LG50, which means that our contigs are same length and quantity in terms of genome average in comparison to K. marxianus DMKU3. The smallest fragment in the primary contigs is 20,533 and 3040 bp in haplotigs as we show in Table 1., K. marxianus SLP1 summary assembly. Statistics of primary contigs and haplotigs. NG50 and LG50 were calculated using K. marxianus DMKU3 as the reference., K. marxianus SLP1 summary assembly. Statistics of primary contigs and haplotigs. NG50 and LG50 were calculated using K. marxianus DMKU3 as the reference., The completeness of the genome as determined by BUSCO software is shown in Figure 2, where haplotypes A and B have 14 and 61 genes, respectively, appearing as duplicated copies due to the divergence between haplotypes. Conversely, 60% of the genes are complete and fragmented, while 40% are missing. Missing genes may be due to either no significant matches, or the BUSCO matches scored below the range of scores for the BUSCO profile. The missing genes could also be due to the assembler used (Falcon) and its limitation with mitochondrial sequences as reported by Hamlin et al. (2019). The assembly completeness in the gene contend term can be used to measure the quality of the assembly, but it is for known genes that are incorporated in databases, and high-quality genomes may reflect the organism’s evolutionary history rather than an incomplete assembly., BUSCO summary of K. marxianus SLP1 haplotypes.

The summary annotation is shown in Table 2, which lists the number of genes, CDS, and tRNAs. Each haplotype was annotated separately; the results show 1429 gene IDs in haplotype A and 1341 gene IDs in haplotype B. The remaining CDS are reported as hypothetical proteins, so we decided to work only with CDS with known function., K. marxianus SLP1 haplotype annotation summary, K. marxianus SLP1 haplotype annotation summary, The enrichment by ontologies in annotated genes in Table 2 is presented by genes in each haplotype, as we described in the Methods section. Figure 3 shows the ontologies present in our yeast strain where some functions are different between haplotypes. Such gained functions could be the consequence of the characteristic variability generated during sexual reproduction that occurs -in the case of K. marxianus- under stressful conditions. The genome contains 187,219 SNPs, 36,674 INS, and 70,565 DEL in haplotype A, and 210,342 SNPs, 41,416 INS, and 68,323 DEL in haplotype B, as reported by Snpeff. In addition, we report the effect of variants at the INU1 gene because its influence on fructan assimilation is a trait of this strain. Table 3 shows 198 variants located in the up- and down-stream regions have an impact as modifiers. However, there are variants have high, low, and moderate impacts. Those with high impact are frameshift variants caused by INDEL, those with moderate impact are missense variants, and those with low impact are synonymous variants.

High, frameshift variant; low, synonymous variant; moderate, missense variant; modifier, up- and downstream gene variant., This is the first report of a diploid K. marxianus living in a fermenting agave must medium. All other polyploid K. marxianus have been isolated from lactic mediums, and Ortiz-Merino et al. (2018) demonstrated that LAC12 (functional and nonfunctional) gene alleles are associated with their chromosome set number. Mo et al. (2019) showed that K. marxianus FIM1, a haploid yeast isolated from nonlactic environments, was highly stable when grown in ethanol-rich medium; our report underlies the need to further study the mechanisms of adaptive polyploidy evolution in fructan-rich growing-medium K. marxianus. Such evidence opens the question if using other carbon-sugar sources is related to the ploidy phenomenon. The ability of K. marxianus SLP1 to consume a variety of substrates and to cope with hostile environments suggests a sexual recombination event that allowed functional gene gain in this strain. Figure 4 depicts the alignment representation of the LAC12 gene from K. marxianus CBS 397 to K. marxianus SLP1 haplotypes. We observe that the sequence of the haplotype A contains the largest number of exclusive substitutions, whereas haplotype B shows the highest homology with the LAC12 reference gene. However, we observe several exclusive substitutions and gaps in both haplotypes compared to the INU1 gene from K. marxianus DMKU3., Alignment scheme of LAC12 and INU1 genes.

This genome assembly of C. makinoi provides an important step forward in understanding the chrysanthemum genome, evolution, and history., As one of the most economically important ornamental crops (Anderson 2007), much time has been invested into understanding Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. and its related varieties and species. One of the key factors of its success as an ornamental crop is the diversity available in petal colors and flower shapes (Song et al. 2018), even though the underlying genomic and molecular basis of the shape traits is still poorly understood. This is partly due to the fact that it is a hexaploid with polysomic inheritance (van Geest et al. 2017b)., To begin to understand a hexaploid such as C. morifolium Ramat. and its traits, we must first look at the whole genus and research the plant’s origins. The Chrysanthemum genus consists of species with a basic number of nine chromosomes but with variable ploidy level, from diploid to decaploid (Wang et al. 2014). Native across Eurasia and the northern parts of North America, the genus consists of 40 different species (Liu et al. 2012; Liu 2020). More than 10 were originally identified as a potential source material for the domesticated C. morifolium Ramat. (Hemsley 1889; Stapf 1933; Dowrick 1952; Ackerson 1967), including Chrysanthemum makinoi (syn. D. makinoi), Chrysanthemum indicum (syn. D. indicum), Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium (syn. D. lavandulifolium), and Chrysanthemum zawadskii (syn. D. zawadskii), predominantly in their hexaploid form. The hexaploid Chrysanthemum vestitum and tetraploid C. indicum were later again suggested as major donors based on comparative morphology, cytology, interspecific hybridization, and molecular systematics (Ma et al. 2016). Diploids such as Chrysanthemum nankingense, C. lavandulifoium, and C. zawadskii have also repeatedly been identified as possible contributors (Dai et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2016). To date, no one has come up with a conclusive model for C. morifolium Ramat., Chrysanthemum makinoi is a wild diploid endemic to Japan. While research has been performed in the past with this diploid species (Tanaka 1960; Tanaka and Shimotomai 1968), no one has attempted to assemble its genome. In fact, to date, of the 40 chrysanthemum species only Chrysanthemum seticuspe (Hirakawa et al. 2019) and C. nankingense (Song et al. 2018) have whole-genome assemblies. The C. seticuspe assembly was made using only short-read sequencing and had a total length of 2.722 Gb, with 354,212 contigs, an N50 of 44,741 bp, and a BUSCO score of 88.8% (Hirakawa et al. 2019), while C. nankingense was assembled using both long and short reads for a total length of 2.527 Gb, with 24,051 contigs, an N50 of 130,678 bp, and a BUSCO score of 92.7% (Song et al. 2018). Generating a more contiguous assembly of these diploids has been difficult as chrysanthemum genomes are very repetitive and heterozygous (Won et al. 2018a; Nguyen et al. 2020)., Long-read data help resolve the repetitive sequences and allows for more contiguous contigs to be assembled (van Dijk et al. 2018), so we proceeded with an approach that combined both long read, short read, and proximity ligation methods to build a truly robust assembly. This assembly, along with its corresponding organelle assemblies and transcriptome, will not only expand our understanding of the diploid C. makinoi but also help illuminate the complicated polyploidization story that led to C. morifolium Ramat. by providing a robust genomic foundation from which to expand., The C. makinoi Matsum. et Nakai or No. JP131333 Ryuunougiku plant, or C. makinoi for short, was obtained from the NARO (Tsukuba, Japan) genebank. Cuttings were grown in greenhouses at Wageningen University and Research (WUR-Unifarm) according to standard procedures., High molecular weight DNA for long-read sequencing was isolated from fresh young C. makinoi leaves using a modified (Bernatzky and Tanksley 1986) protocol. Libraries were prepped using the 1D ligation sequencing kits SQK-LSK108 and SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) according to the instructions. The samples were sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore GridION using 40 flow cells and the standard protocol. Adaptors were removed using Porechop (Wick 2018) and reads were filtered using Filtlong (Wick 2019), which removed the worst 10% of reads from the shorter reads., One sample was also sequenced using four differently sized insert libraries (270, 350, 400, and 500 bp) and 150-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (GenomeScan, Leiden, The Netherlands). Samples were processed using the NEBNext® Ultra DNA library Prep Kit from Illumina. Genome characteristics were estimated using Jellyfish v2.2.10 (Marçais and Kingsford 2011) k-mer counts and GenomeScope (Vurture et al. 2017)., High molecular weight DNA of C. makinoi was also sequenced by GenomeScan across eight SMRTcells using a PacBio “Sequel SMRT Cell 1M v2” sequencer. Sample preparation was done based on the “PacBio SMRTbell Express Kit v1” protocol. The final library was selected using the Blue Pippin protocol for fragments larger than 15 kb. Primer and polymerase were attached using the “Sequel Binding and Internal Ctrl Kit2.1” kit and purification was done using the PacBio “Procedure & Checklist—AMPure® PB Bead Purication of Polymerase Bound SMRTbell® Complexes” protocol. Sequencing was performed for 10 h on seven of the cells and 20 h for the remaining cell with the recommended amount of “DNA Internal Control Complex 2.1”. The raw data were assessed with the SMRT Link Analysis server v5.1.0.26367 by GenomeScan., Four tissues (leaves, stems, floral buds, and flowers) used in the study were obtained from a C. makinoi cultivated in a greenhouse under long-day conditions, 20-h light/4-h dark cycle, or under short-day conditions, 11-h light/13-h dark cycle, at Dekker Chrysanten (Hensbroek, The Netherlands). All collected plant tissues were frozen immediately in liquid N2 and stored at −70°C until the RNA was extracted and isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and library prepped using the PCR-cDNA sequencing kit (SQK-PCS109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced separately on an Oxford Nanopore GridION using nine flow cells in total, according to the standard protocol. Quality control was done using NanoComp v1.9.2 (De Coster et al. 2018) and fastq validator from fastq_utils v0.21.0 (Fonseca and Manning) with duplicate read IDs removed., Nanopore reads were base-called with Guppy v3.2 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and filtered to keep only the reads from the “pass” folder (Q ≥ 7) that had a length above 20 kb and the “fail” folder (Q < 7) with a length over 50 kb. PacBio reads over 30- kb long were also added into this dataset. This combination of long reads was assembled using SMARTdenovo v1.0.0 (Liu et al. 2021) with “generate consensus” set to 1. Purge Haplotigs (Roach et al. 2018) was then used to flatten regions of heterozygosity into a single consensus sequence. Illumina data were subsequently used in conjunction with ntEdit v0.9 (Warren et al. 2019) in mode 2 and with a K = 50 for two iterations to polish the contigs. Contiguity was further improved with the use of Hi-C and Chicago proximity ligation methods (Dovetail Genomics, Scotts Valley, USA). Final pseudo-molecule level scaffolding was performed using ALLMAPS v0.9.14 (Tang et al. 2015) and an integrated genetic map of hexaploid chrysanthemum (van Geest et al. 2017a; see Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Some by-hand misassembly corrections, verified with the raw long-read data, were also completed (see Supplementary Figure S2). Contigs that remained unplaced among the nine chromosomes in the final assembly were filtered to remove contaminants and unusually high coverage reads. The final chromosomes were named and numbered following the linkage group assignments in a C. morifolium Ramat. cross found in van Geest et al. (2017a). Read coverage was assessed using Qualimap bamqc v2.2.1 (Okonechnikov et al. 2016) and contigs with no or high coverage (>4x the mean coverage) were removed. Subsequently, contaminantsequences were identified using Centrifuge v1.0.4 (Kim et al. 2016) using the NCBI’s viral and bacterial libraries (accessed in November 2019) and removed. The remaining reads were placed into a chromosome zero with N-gaps of 200 bp in between each contig., Organelles were assembled by extracting Nanopore and Illumina reads that aligned to the available C. seticuspe (syn. C. boreale) chloroplast (Won et al. 2018b) and mitochondria (Won et al. 2018c) references using Minimap2 v2.17 (Li 2018) and BWA-MEM v0.7.17-r1198-dirty (Li 2013), respectively. A hybrid assembly was then performed for each organelle using Unicycler v0.4.8 (Wick et al. 2017). This resulted in a single, circular scaffold assembly for the chloroplast and multiple circular scaffolds for the mitochondria. Based on a visual inspection of each of the mitochondria scaffolds against known chrysanthemum mitochondria assemblies, scaffold 1 was found to represent the entire sequence and was selected as the full circular assembly of the mitochondria genome., QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al. 2013) was used to determine the basic statistics of the final genome assembly such as total length, N50 and the number of contigs/scaffolds. BUSCO v4.0.5 (Simão et al. 2015) and the corresponding set of Embryophyta odb10 universal single-copy orthologs was also used to assess the completeness of the genome., Before annotating the assembly, we soft-masked the repetitive sequences using RepeatModeler v2.0.1 (Flynn et al. 2020)., Gene prediction was done with the Funannotate v1.7.4 (Palmer 2017) pipeline. First, the Funannotate pipeline was trained using the cDNA long reads, UniProtKB v2020_04 database (Bateman 2019), and the BUSCO eukaryote odb9 protein database (Simão et al. 2015), to create the input dataset for the Funannotate predict pipeline. The predict pipeline was then run with standard settings and the GeneMark-ET, Augustus, GlimmerHMM, and Snap algorithms. Afterward, filtering of the ab initio gene predictions was done using EVidenceModeler (EVM; Haas et al. 2008)., To functionally annotate the predicted models, an initial comparison was done using blastp v2.6.0 (Camacho et al. 2009) against the SWISS-PROT v4 database (Bairoch and Apweiler 2000) with a cut-off e-value of 1.0E−3, a word size of 6, a maximum number of hits set to 20, and the low complexity filter turned on. To identify the domains within the predicted model sets, InterProScan v5.26 (Jones et al. 2014) was used along with the panther v12.0 libraries. Finally, the results were processed by a stand-alone version of Blast2Go (Götz et al. 2008) using default settings., Nanopore sequencing resulted in 443.25 Gb of data with a read N50 of 22.6 kb. After base calling, removing adaptors and filtering for reads over 20 kb in length from the “pass” folder, which had a Q score of >7, and for reads over 50 kb in length from the “fail” folder, the dataset had a coverage of approximately 53× (assuming a haploid genome size of 3.1 GB) and consisted of 3,924,770 reads. Illumina HiSeq yielded 113.2, 142.0, 133.7, and 120.0 Gb of raw data for the 270, 350, 400, and 500 bp insert size libraries, respectively. Between 90.5% and 94.6% of reads in each insert size had a quality “q” score of greater than or equal to 30. PacBio sequencing resulted in 70 Gb of data with an average subread length of 15.5 kb and an N50 of 24.1 kb. This meant a coverage of approximately 30.6× (assuming a haploid genome size of 3.1 GB)., The nanopore cDNA sequencing resulted in datasets with 4.8–7.9 million reads, an average N50 of 1.2–1.4 kb and between 5.0 and 7.9 Gb total (Table 1).,  Sequencing details of cDNA from different plant organs in C. makinoi,  Sequencing details of cDNA from different plant organs in C. makinoi, k-mers (K = 31) were extracted from the paired-end HiSeq Illumina reads, counted using Jellyfish v2.2.10 (Marçais and Kingsford 2011) and analyzed with GenomeScope (Vurture et al. 2017) to estimate the genome haploid length, heterozygosity, and repeat content. The analysis converged and estimated a haploid genome size of 1.72 Gb, a heterozygosity of 1.51% (this value ranges from ∼0% to 2% (Vurture et al. 2017)) and marked 53.6% of the genome as unique (Figure 1). This indicates that the genome is repetitive and highly heterozygous. The haploid genome size of the chrysanthemum diploids has been estimated between 2.90 ± 0.03 Gb for C. seticuspe (Hirakawa et al. 2019) and 3.24 Gb for C. nankingense (Song et al. 2018) using flow cytometry. Previous genome size estimate of a C. makinoi (Nakano et al. 2019) suggested that the genome was approximately 10% larger than C. seticuspe, or approximately 3.19 Gb. The Genome Size Asteraceae Database estimates an average 1C of 3.82 Gb for chrysanthemum using flow cytometry, though this is likely an overestimation as the median is 3.1 Gb (Garnatje et al. 2011). It is known that sequence-based genome estimation methods underestimate genome size (Pflug et al. 2020) with GenomeScope being particularly sensitive to the k-mer count cut-off parameter (Vurture et al. 2017). This parameter is meant to distinguish repetitive sequences from organelle sequences, so that the repetitive k-mers are used to calculate the genome size while organelle k-mers are discarded, but this becomes impossible if the repetitive sequence k-mers are as abundant as the organelle k-mers (Vurture et al. 2017). With the high level of heterozygosity indicated by GenomeScope and confirmed with later analyses, it would be difficult to distinguish these k-mers from each other, resulting in many of the repetitive region k-mers also being discarded and producing a substantially underestimated genome size. We expect a true genome size closer to the previous cytometry predictions of 3.19 Gb (Nakano et al. 2019)., A k-mer (K = 31) distribution based on the illumina reads, modeled and visualized using genomescope., A k-mer (K = 31) distribution based on the illumina reads, modeled and visualized using genomescope., After initial assembly with SMARTdenovo (Ruan et al. 2017) we had 39,105 contigs, spanning 4.1 Gb, with an N50 of 139.2 kb. Purge Haplotigs (Roach et al. 2018) produced a flattened assembly of 15,236 contigs, spanning 3.1 Gb, with an N50 of 255.8 kb. After two rounds of polishing with ntEdit v0.9 (Warren et al. 2019) using Illumina data, the assembly size was 3.1 Gb and made up of 15,226 contigs, with an N50 of 258.2 kb., To scaffold the contigs, maps were generated using Hi-C and Chicago proximity ligation methods. This method generated 4254 scaffolds, covering a total length of 3.1 Gb, with an N50 of 168.9 Mb. The assembly was further superscaffolded into pseudochromosomes using ALLMAPS v0.9.14 (Tang et al. 2015) using a genetic map from a hexaploid C. moriflorium Ramat. (van Geest et al. 2017a). This resulted in a final assembly that was 3.1 Gb long and scaffolded into nine pseudochromosomes, with an N50 and L50 of 330.0 Mb and five scaffolds, respectively (Table 2).,  C. makinoi de novo genome assembly metrics estimated using QUAST,  C. makinoi de novo genome assembly metrics estimated using QUAST, The unplaced contigs were curated before being placed into chromosome 0 using the classification engine Centrifuge v1.0.4 (Kim et al. 2016). Of the 4206 unplaced contigs, 824 were marked as coming from a non-eukaryote source and removed. The Illumina reads were also aligned back to all the contigs using Minimap2 v2.17 (Li 2018) and, then, their coverage was assessed using Qualimap v2.2.1 (Okonechnikov et al. 2016). Contigs with a coverage higher than one standard deviation from the average were removed. This resulted in a final set of 3337 contigs, covering a total of 198.3 Mb, which were placed into chromosome 0., BUSCO scores, which provide a set of universal single-copy orthologs, were also used to assess the completeness of the assemblies (see Table 3). Using the Embryophyta odb10 set with BUSCO v4.0.5 (Simão et al. 2015), the final assembly had a complete BUSCO score of 92.1% indicating a high overall quality. A full breakdown of the BUSCO score can be seen in Table 3.,  Output from the Busco analysis pipeline to assess gene complement completeness,  Output from the Busco analysis pipeline to assess gene complement completeness, For comparison, the exclusively short-read-based assembly of C. seticuspe had a total length of 2.722 Gb, with 354,212 contigs, an N50 of 44.7 kb, and the BUSCO score of 88.8% (Hirakawa et al. 2019). The C. nankingense assembly had a total length of 2.527 Gb, with 24,051 contigs, an N50 of 130.7 kb, and the BUSCO score of 92.7% (Song et al. 2018). Thus, we were able to produce a substantially more contiguous assembly without sacrificing completeness., Using RepeatModeler (Flynn et al. 2020), 80.04% of the genome was marked as repetitive. Large genomes have accumulated repeats (Kelly and Leitch, 2011) and the k-mer analysis already indicated we were dealing with a largely repetitive genome. Of the 6799 identified repeat families in C. makinoi, 76.6% were identified as long terminal repeats (LTRs). Of the LTRs, 27.1% could be identified as Copia and 7.4% as Gypsy. A similar analysis in C. nankingense marked 69.6% of their assembly as repetitive and found LTRs to make up 67.7% of the identified tandem repeats, with 36.5% being Copia and 30.9% being Gypsy (Song et al. 2018). The lower rate of repetitiveness and identified LTRs in C. nankingense may be due to the difference in contiguity, with C. nankingense consisting of over 24,000 contigs (Song et al. 2018) to our 9 pseudochromosomes and 3337 unplaced contigs, as it has been shown that more complete genome assemblies will identify more LTRs (Ou et al. 2018). Analysis of various Asteraceae has shown fluctuations between members in relative abundance of Copia vs Gypsy, with sunflower (Helianthus annuus) amplifying Gyspy over Copia (Cavallini et al. 2010; Buti et al. 2011; Natali et al. 2013; Giordani et al. 2014; Badouin et al. 2017) while horseweed (Conyza canadensis) and globe artichoke (Cynara Cardunculus var. scolymus) showed the reverse (Peng et al. 2014; Scaglione et al. 2016). Earlier studies with C. nankingense and C. seticuspe (syn. C. boreale) suggested that in chrysanthemum the abundances of Copia and Gypsy were similar, with Copia being slightly more abundant and undergoing amplification slightly earlier (Song et al. 2018; Won et al. 2018a), but our results suggest that, at least in C. makinoi, there is a more substantial difference in abundance, like that seen in horseweed and globe artichoke. A systematic analysis of a variety of chrysanthemum species at various ploidy levels should be undertaken to gain better insight as these repeat types are a known driving force of plant genome evolution (Todorovska 2007)., Each algorithm in the Funannotate (Palmer 2017) pipeline produced a set of ab initio gene models (see Supplementary Table S2). The evidence for each gene model was weighed using an EVM approach and identified 95,064 ab initio predicted gene models. This is higher than the plant average of 36,795 (Ramírez-Sánchez et al. 2016) but could be explained by the presence of pseudogenes (Xiao et al. 2016). Other Asteraceae including Artemisia annua (63,226 gene models; Shen et al. 2018), sunflower (52,232 gene models; Badouin et al. 2017), Mikania micrantha (46,351 gene models; Liu et al. 2020), C. seticuspe (71,057 gene models; Hirakawa et al. 2019), and C. nankingense (56,870 gene models; Song et al. 2018) also have substantially more than the average number of gene models. To investigate this further, an analysis of the structure and length of the annotated genes was also performed. The genes had an average coding sequence length of 876 bp and a maximum of 12,735 bp. This is shorter than the average plant gene length of 1308 bp but within the first quartile of average plant gene length (Ramírez-Sánchez et al. 2016). In line with the finding that plants tend to have less exons per protein than other organisms (Ramírez-Sánchez et al. 2016), 15.9% of the genes in C. makinoi were found to consist of a single exon. The average intron length within our gene set was found to be 446 bp, with a range of 11–19,668 bp and a median of 140 bp. This indicates that the majority of introns are relatively small. The distribution is similar to what has been found in maize (which had a mean of 516 bp and a median of 146 bp; Schnable et al. 2009)., Another explanation for the predicted genes being more abundant then is that average in plants could be due to ancient genome duplication. It has previously been reported that there was an ancient whole-genome triplication (WGT-γ) in dicotyledons (approximately 122–164 MYA) and another whole-genome triplication (WGT-1), before the split between asterids I and II, approximately 53–62 MYA (Badouin et al. 2017; Won et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2020). In addition, an analysis of the synonymous substitution rates of the paralogous and orthologous genes of the transcriptome assemblies of the hexaploid C. morifolium Ramat. and wild Korean diploid C. boreale revealed a whole-genome duplication or triplication event specific to chrysanthemum (Won et al. 2017). The assembly and annotation of more high-quality chrysanthemum genomes will help to clarify the genus’s evolution and its contributions to gene abundance., Typically transposable elements accumulate in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions as they establish, maintain, and stabilize the centromeres of eukaryotes (Klein and O’Neill 2018). Thus, one can estimate the centromeric region of a chromosome based on a low gene density (Figure 2; red ring) and high repetitive sequence density (Figure 2; orange ring) but this pattern is not visible in C. makinoi as both the genes (red ring) and repetitive sequences (orange ring) are evenly distributed across. In fact, instead of clustering by region, the repetitive sequence density in C. makinoi has a positive Pearson correlation value of 0.60 with gene density. A possible explanation for this correlation is that chrysanthemum, like other Asteraceae, has LTRs driving a lot of diversity (Wang et al. 2014). Each LTR family has its own distribution characteristics in plant genomes (Chen 2007; Zhang et al. 2014) and LTRs make up 76.6% of the identified repeat families in C. makinoi. The sheer volume of the LTRs that distribute in gene-rich areas could be overwhelming the signal of repetitive sequences with a centromeric/pericentromeric preference. This is further supported by the previous work on repetitive elements in C. seticuspe (syn. C. boreale) that found, using optical techniques, a strong enrichment for LTRs and that the majority of repetitive sequences identified did not show a preference for centromeric or peri-centromeric regions (Won et al. 2018a)., Circos plot showing the pseudomolecules (outer ring), gene density (red ring), repetitive element content (orange ring), and gc content (yellow ring) with a bin size of 500 kb., Circos plot showing the pseudomolecules (outer ring), gene density (red ring), repetitive element content (orange ring), and gc content (yellow ring) with a bin size of 500 kb., Blast2Go (Götz et al. 2008) was used to functionally annotate the final gene model set. From our predicted gene models, 11.0% were assigned a putative functional label and 2.9% an enzyme code. Looking at the GO-level distribution, the majority of the gene models that were annotated as relating to a biological process (P) or molecular function (F) could not be identified to a high level of specificity, except the cellular component (C) annotated genes (see Supplementary Figure S3). This means that Blast2Go struggled to be more specific about the function of the identified biological process genes beyond, i.e., “nitrogen compound metabolic process” but could get much more specific with the cellular component annotated genes., Having assembled the most complete and contiguous chrysanthemum genome available to date we have made an important step forward in our understanding of the genomics of this complex and important ornamental crop. This reference will provide a guide for further research in chrysanthemum breeding traits, origin, and strategies for assembling related higher ploidy varieties. This genome can act as a reference to assist in the ordering of other diploid chrysanthemum sequences as well as help to reduce the complexity of assembly in closely related polyploids as has been done in several other species (Lukaszewski et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015; Bertioli et al. 2016; Kyriakidou et al. 2018; Edger et al. 2019)., The final assembly and annotation files for C. makinoi Matsum. et Nakai (Japanese name: Ryuunougiku) No. JP131333 are available for download at www.chrysanthemumgenome.wur.nl/, along with a genome browser.

Although less significant on the global schema of cutaneous and mucosal disease, such genomic studies of L. naiffi and L. guyanensis substantiate the gaps in understanding of the molecular architecture and multivariate clinical pictures of Leishmaniasis, on an international scale., Parasites of the genus Leishmania cause various diseases named leishmaniases; this parasite has been classified into four different subgenera: Leishmania (Leishmania), Leishmania (Mundinia), Leishmania (Sauroleishmania), and Leishmania (Viannia) (Espinosa et al. 2018), being L. (Viannia) and Leishmania (Leishmania) the subgenera with the highest distribution worldwide and with a genome size of ∼32 Mb (Butenko et al. 2019). Nine subgenera L. (Viannia) (sub)species have been described so far, including L. naiffi and L. guyanensis (Espinosa et al. 2018). Leishmaniasis is a parasite-effected disease state in mammals, which manifests in symptoms on a spectrum from tegumentary to visceral, depending on interplay between host, vector, and pathogen physiology. In South America, the cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms predominate, with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) and Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL) being chiefly brought about by Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania panamensis, and L. guyanensis. Leishmania naiffi has also been linked with CL cases (Ovalle-Bracho et al. 2019; Correa-Cardenas et al. 2020)., Since 1989, when the first clinical descriptions of CL by L. naiffi emerged from Brazil (Ducharme et al. 2020), DNA samples of this species have been retrieved from murine (Cassia-Pires et al. 2014; Roque and Jansen 2014) and sand fly hosts (Silva et al. 2021). Albeit rare to cause disease in humans (and in such cases, responsive to therapy), instances of CL are regularly described in connection to L. naiffi throughout South America (Correa-Cardenas et al. 2020; Ducharme et al. 2020; de Almeida et al. 2021). Some studies even denote parasite resistance to first-line therapy (Ducharme et al. 2020). In Colombia, L. naiffi infection has been reported in humans as well as in Canis lupus familiaris (Correa-Cardenas et al. 2020; Patiño et al. 2021)., Leishmania guyanensis, is contrarily a well-established instigator of CL and MCL in South America, being described throughout the continent, including regions of Colombia and Venezuela (Delgado et al. 1997; Couppie et al. 2004; Ovalle-Bracho et al. 2019; Olivier and Zamboni 2020; Santos et al. 2020). Infection by this species is likewise known to materialize in symptoms of Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (DCL) and Disseminated Leishmaniasis (DL). To date, analyses of genomic singularities of L. naiffi and L. guyanensis from patient isolates in the endemic localities of Venezuela and Colombia have been sparse. Herein, we describe whole-genome sequencing of these two species, isolated from human cutaneous lesions of patients from Mérida, Venezuela, and Guaviare, Colombia., This study accrued from two initial clinical samples of patients with CL: the S8104 isolated from a 51-year-old man in Merida, Venezuela and the HOMI-81 isolated from a 25-year-old male in Guaviare, Colombia., Parasite isolates were obtained from samples of cutaneous lesions. The DNA was extracted and divided into two groups: the first, for species identification by nucleotide amplification and Sanger sequencing of the HSP70 gene; the second, for whole-genome sequencing following the protocols previously described (Patino et al. 2020). The paired-end Illumina reads obtained from the HOMI-81 and S8104 isolates were mapped to the reference genomes of L. naiffi LnCL223 and L. guyanensis LgCL085 (Coughlan et al. 2018) and assembled with the SMALT program (V-0.7.4; www.sanger.ac.UK/resources/software/smalt/). Statistics obtained during the sequencing of each isolate is presented in Supplementary Table S1., For the chromosomal somy estimation, the median read depth of each chromosome was initially calculated (di). Subsequently, the median depth (dm) of the whole genome (35 chromosomes) for L. guyanensis and L. naiffi was calculated. Finally, the somy (S-value) of each chromosome was obtained using the following formula: S = 2 × di/dm (Cuypers et al. 2018). The ranges of somy (mono-di-tri-tetra and penta somy) were defined as previously described (Patiño et al. 2020). To evaluate the gene copy number variations (CNVs), we calculated and related the average haploid depth per gene without somy effect (dHG) and the full cell depth with somy effect (dFG) using the formula: (dFG = S × dHG). The statistical significance used in this study was set at a z-score cutoff of >2 and an adjusted P-value (Student’s t-test) of <0.05 (Patiño et al. 2020). The heatmaps were created using the Heatmap3 package in R (Zhao et al. 2014)., Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alignments from whole-nuclear and mitochondrial (maxicircle) genomes were used to evaluate the phylogenomic relationships between the isolates sequenced in this study, in addition to other species of the L. (Viannia) subgenus. Maximum likelihood trees were inferred using IQ-TREE 2 (Minh et al. 2020). The robustness of the nodes was evaluated using the Bootstrap (BT) method (with 1000 replicates). The obtained tree was visualized using the tool Interactive Tree Of Life V4 (http://itol.embl.de; Letunic and Bork 2019). To detect recombination signatures phylogenetic networks were built in SplitsTree5 (Huson and Bryant 2006) using the neighbor-net method. All metadata on genomes are summarized in Supplementary Table S2., Reads of each genome were mapped to corresponding reference genomes using the SMALT program (version 0.7.4) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0). The Picard program (V-1.85) (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used for merging and sorting bam files and marking duplicated reads, as described previously (Patiño et al. 2020). Additionally, the SNPs were called with the population-based Unified Genotyper method in the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; version 3.4; https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/), where SNPs were called among all the samples simultaneously. Later, we realigned around indels to remove these and retrieved only the SNPs. GATK Variant Filtration was used to filter Low-quality SNPs, according to the following criteria: QD < 2.0 ‖ MQ < 40 ‖ FS > 60.0 ‖ ReadPosRankSum < −8.0. Once the SNPs were independently detected, the data were included in an Excel matrix, which was used to perform the comparative analysis. Finally, the data corresponding to the allele frequency (AF) were exported in txt files from the SNPs file using VCFtools recode option and SelectVariants—VariantsToTable options of GATK, and then, plotted using the plot function of R. The homozygous and heterozygous variant SNPs were determined from AF estimation data as reported elsewhere (Tihon et al. 2017)., Two alignments were used to perform phylogenomic analyses. The first corresponded to SNPs from nuclear genome, where 345,167 variable sites and 264,298 parsimony-informative SNPs were identified. The second corresponded to SNPs from mitochondrial genomes where 156 variable sites and 128 parsimony-informative SNPs were identified. The results obtained demonstrate a close relationship between both Nuclear and Maxicircle SNPs of the HOMI-81 and S8104 genomes sequenced here, and the respective reference genomes of L. naiffi (L. naiffi_LnCL223) and L. guyanensis (L. guyanensis LgCL085; Coughlan et al. 2018; Figure 1, A and B). Furthermore, to analyze the genomes from L. (Viannia) subgenera, we noticed the formation of three independent clusters: cluster 1 (highlighted in light orange) included the genomes of L. braziliensis and Leishmania peruviana, the cluster 2 (highlighted in light blue), was represented for all L. naiffi genomes analyzed in this study and the cluster 3 (highlighted in light purple) included not only the L. guyanensis genomes herein analyzed but also the L. panamensis and Leishmania shawi genomes. These findings are supported by phylogenetic network topologies (Figure 1, C and D)., Nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies of L. naiffi and L. guyanensis genomes analyzed. The trees located to the left of the figure represent the phylogenomic analysis based on nuclear (A) and mitochondrial: Maxicircle (B) SNP alignments of sequences analyzed in this study.

Black dots represent well-supported nodes (BT ≥ 90%). The right panel represents the phylogenetic network (NeighborNet) constructed in SplitsTree 5, based on nuclear (C) and mitochondrial: Maxicircle (D) SNPs alignments for the genomes analyzed., We noted chromosomal homogeneity across the genomes of HOMI-81 and S8104 isolates—their karyotypes being mostly disomic (Figure 2). We attribute the nominal genomic plasticity observed at the chromosomal levels of both isolates to be a likely effect of minimal recombination events, as had been previously demonstrated in Trypanosoma brucei subspecies (Almeida et al. 2018). Contrastively, low genomic plasticity could be due to recent introduction of these varieties to the latitudes in question, and the initial adaptation period of the species to novel human hosts, vectors, and zoonotic reservoirs., Evaluation of chromosomal copy number in the L. naiffi and L. guyanensis genomes analyzed. The heatmap shows the estimated copy number of the 35 chromosomes (y-axis) in the genomes analyzed (x-axis) (A) L. naiffi and (B) L. guyanensis genomes.

Disomic (blue), trisomic (green), and tetrasomic (orange)., We highlight structural similarities between the HOMI-81 isolate, and the Brazilian L. naiffi genome (M5533) of Edentata/Dasypus origin (Figure 2A). This line of evidence implies that the L. naiffi strain localized to Colombia could be derivative of a sylvatic variety adapted to continuous displacement within regions where zoonotic reservoirs and sand fly vectors are abundant (Kato et al. 2013; Ferro et al. 2015). Such reasoning has important epidemiological implications in Colombia as political unrest occasions continuous human displacement in the country of people between rural and urban areas. A similar scenario applies to Venezuela, a country facing a serious humanitarian crisis, which has led to massive displacement of refugees and migrants to neighboring countries. By default, human migration equates to dispersion of parasite species., In addition, we ascertained greater structural similarity between the S8104 isolate, and the genome from French Guyana (L. guyanensis_SRR8179913), than the four Brazilian genomes analyzed in this study (L. guyanensis LgCL085, L. guyanensis M4147, L. guyanensis SRR8584811, and L. guyanensis ERR476933; Figure 2B). Calibrating these findings with the geographical proximity of these genomes, and the inherent capacity of adaptation/evolution of L. guyanensis to diverse ecological niches, we surmise that the pathogenic L. guyanensis strain circulating in Brazil is structurally dissimilar to the strains of the same species, issuing from the Caribbean coast of South America. Such suppositions cannot however be confirmed until more whole-genome studies of L. guyanensis are carried out, alike to this one., Moreover, we observed low frequency of CNV amongst the genes on both isolates (82 genes in HOM1-81 and 66 genes in S8104). A total of 71 and 40 CNV genes were shared between all L. naiffi and L. guyanensis genomes analyzed respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Interestingly, these genes were associated with survival, virulence; drug/ROS stress resistance, host immune evasion, glucose metabolism, and metastasis. Additionally, we highlight the genes that encode telomere-associated mobile elements DNA, which until date, have only been described in L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis, and L. naiffi (Coughlan et al. 2018) and the genes associated with autophagy (ATG8/AUT7/APG8/PAZ2), as showing high CNV in L. guyanensis but not in L. naiffi species., In the terms of SNPs we report higher genetic heterogeneity in the HOMI-81 isolates (214,474 SNPs) as compared with 85,238 SNPs within L. naiffi M5533 isolates (Supplementary Table S5). Such distinct characters of genetic variability between the two strains could be the result of their historical geographic distributions and the coordinate exigency to have adapted to the ecological environments of everchanging hosts. More proficient sampling of L. naiffi is necessary to confirm these hypotheses., Regarding the S8104 isolates, we identified 131,626 SNPs within the L. guyanensis genome—agreeing with the equally high heterogeneity of the remaining L. guyanensis genomes analyzed (Supplementary Table S5). Thereby, our findings confirm that L. guyanensis, like L. braziliensis (Patiño et al. 2020) present a high degree of genetic variability. As in the case of L. naiffi, this variability is to be associated with the equally diverse opportunities had by the parasite to install itself in variable arthropod vector species and zoonotic hosts (Rotureau et al. 2006; Ramirez et al. 2016). The genetic heterogeneity of L. guyanensis could parallel its capacities to instigate diverse clinical pictures of disease and resistance to common therapies (Borges et al. 2018). Although previous studies describe that L. guyanensis, L. panamensis, and L. shawi are a monophyletic species complex as demonstrated through Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA), Multilocus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE), and hsp70 analysis (Coughlan et al. 2018), the whole-genome analysis of these species, has allowed to evidence a considerable genomic variability between them, in terms of SNPs/indels and gene and chromosome CNVs (Coughlan et al. 2018), which could support the idea that although they are closely related, they could be distinct species, as was demonstrated when comparing the whole genome of L. braziliensis and L. peruviana (Valdivia et al. 2015). However, we believe that the analysis of a larger number of genomes is necessary to clarify if these are distinct species or belong to a single genetic group., In conclusion, this is the first study to report the whole-genome sequence of Colombian L. naiffi and Venezuelan L. guyanensis isolates. A detailed genomic analysis of both isolates has demonstrated similar low structural variability at the chromosomal level, across the board. We observed high genetic heterogeneity on the basis of generous SNPs, which we attribute to the initial adaptation process of the species to new human hosts and novel environmental niches, not necessarily involving genetic alterations at the structural level. Nevertheless, new isolates need to be sequenced to support these hypotheses., The dataset generated during the study was deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the study accession number PRJEB46091., Supplementary material is available at G3 online., We thank to the Programa de Control y Estudio de Enfermedades Tropicales (PECET) and the Hospital Militar Central, Bogotá, Colombia, for assistance with sampling.

A principal component analysis clearly separated resequenced individuals, while inferring population size history using the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent model noted an approximate species split 1 million years ago, and a single, possibly recently introgressed individual., High-throughput sequencing studies on hybrid zones of wild non-model species have revealed traits associated with divergence in sympatry and allopatry (Scordato et al. 2017), patterns of introgression that differ between populations (Nolte et al. 2009), and genes associated with reproductive isolation (Teeter et al. 2008). Whole-genome sequencing provides insight into the evolutionary process of hybridization and adaptive introgression, however, demonstrating the adaptive or fitness values of introgressed genomic regions remains an area of difficulty (Taylor and Larson 2019). Studies of this kind benefit from a reference genome as a basis for identifying genomic regions of interest, and against which it is possible to evaluate potential hybrids and introgressed individuals (Payseur and Rieseberg 2016)., Hybridization and introgression can occur between closely related species brought into secondary contact (Chown et al. 2015). An increase in global surface temperatures has led to range shifts among a variety of taxa on a global scale (Chen et al. 2011) and increasing secondary contact between closely related species (Krosby et al. 2015), leading to increased opportunities for hybridization (Garroway et al. 2010; Chunco 2014). Hybridization can be an evolutionary dead end, or it can lead to adaptive introgression (Arnold and Martin 2009; Abbott et al. 2013). Introgression can result in the merging of hybridizing forms, reinforcement of reproductive barriers through selection for assortative mating, and a non-neutral shift in fitness among introgressed individuals. In some instances, this enables the expansion of the introgressed species into a novel habitat (Arnold 1992). Further complicating this, adaptive introgression combined with climate change can weaken reproductive isolation (Owens and Samuk 2020). In its extreme form, hybridization can drive extinction through introgression (Rhymer and Simberloff 1996)., Climate-driven range expansions have been noted in mammals, insects, and fish (Moritz et al. 2008; Garroway et al. 2010; Muhlfeld et al. 2014; Scriber 2014), among other taxa. Instances of hybridization in wild ecosystems can be exacerbated by climate change because of increased secondary contact, where barriers to interspecific reproduction are reduced or removed altogether (Chunco 2014). Without such barriers, species that were previously allopatric might interbreed, possibly leading to genetic admixture and outbreeding depression or heterosis (Barton 2001; Rius and Darling 2014)., As climate-mediated range expansion has been shown to increase distributional overlap between related species (Chunco 2014), climate change will therefore likely drive interspecific hybridization between many taxa. For example, studies in North America have noted hybrid zones across a latitudinal gradient between southern (Glaucomys volans) and northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) flying squirrels (Garroway et al. 2010; Rogic et al. 2016). Interspecific hybridization is a key conservation concern for these flying squirrel species, as population declines among northern flying squirrels have been noted in some areas of the United States, where some populations are endangered (Wood et al. 2016). The potential for introgressive hybridization and the subsequent ecological and fitness consequences necessitates a holistic assessment of species biology in the Glaucomys hybrid zone. The hybrid zone can be a valuable study system to facilitate the assessment of interspecific hybridization, the potential for reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and the associated ecological conclusions in a wild, in vivo system., Low hybrid fitness can also lead to increased divergence between species through reinforcement. Glaucomys hybrid offspring are viable and can successfully backcross with either parental species (Garroway et al. 2010), however, the fitness implications among hybrid or introgressed individuals is unknown. The purpose of our study was to generate a de novo reference genome for Glaucomys as a basis for identifying genomic regions of interest and to aid in evaluation of potential hybrids and introgressed individuals in future research. We annotated the reference genome using our already assembled and annotated flying squirrel transcriptome (Brown et al., 2021). Subsequently, using short reads from four individuals, two northern and two southern flying squirrels, we assembled re-sequenced high coverage genomes by aligning to the reference genome for a comparative analysis and demographic history reconstruction., We isolated brain tissue from two adult G. volans and two adult G. sabrinus for sequencing. Approximately 1.0 g of frozen brain tissue was removed from the hindbrain of each individual and immediately stored in RNAlater-ICE (see Brown et al., 2021 for additional details). Glaucomys sabrinus individuals were collected from near Kawartha Highlands Signature Site Park (Northern Flying Squirrel 6525; NFS_6525, female; 44.689°N, 78.335°W) and in Algonquin Provincial Park, ON, Canada (Northern Flying Squirrel 50254; NFS_50254, male; 45.583°N, 78.466°W), and G. volans individuals were sampled near Sherborne Lake (Southern Flying Squirrel 25428; SFS_25428, male; 45.179°N, 78.840°W) and Clear Creek, Ontario, Canada (Southern Flying Squirrel CC1; SFS_CC1, female; 42.523°N, 81.628°W; Figure 1). Algonquin Provincial Park (NFS_50254) was outside the northern edge of the hybrid zone, and Clear Creek (SFS_CC1) was outside the range of G. sabrinus and not an area of sympatry. The sites were all mature, closed canopy forests with a mixture of temperate deciduous trees such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red oak (Quercus rubra), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and coniferous trees such as white pine (Pinus strobus) in uplands or white spruce (Picea glauca) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) in riparian areas (see Bowman et al. 2005 for more details). All four specimens were morphologically identified to their parental species. Squirrel tissue samples were extracted using a phenol-chloroform extraction. The extracted DNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel and Qubit fluorometer using the High Sensitivity Assay Kit to ensure we had sufficient DNA. The DNA extractions were also run on a Nanodrop ND-8000 spectrophotometer to test purity. The DNA was normalized to 20 ng/µl at a final volume of 50 µl., Range of northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern (Glaucomys volans) flying squirrels as delineated by IUCN (Cassola 2016a, 2016b), overlaid with sampling locations. The geographic ranges are represented in the same colors as samples, while the hybrid zone is represented in olive. Both the northernmost G. sabrinus sample from Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, and the southernmost G. volans sample from Clear Creek, Ontario, were located outside of the hybrid zone. The southernmost G. volans sample (SFS_CC1) was used for de novo assembly., Range of northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern (Glaucomys volans) flying squirrels as delineated by IUCN (Cassola 2016a, 2016b), overlaid with sampling locations. The geographic ranges are represented in the same colors as samples, while the hybrid zone is represented in olive. Both the northernmost G. sabrinus sample from Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, and the southernmost G. volans sample from Clear Creek, Ontario, were located outside of the hybrid zone. The southernmost G. volans sample (SFS_CC1) was used for de novo assembly., Southern flying squirrel libraries from individual SFS_CC1 were prepared and paired-end sequenced on 1 lane on an Illumina HiSeq X to generate 150 base pair (bp) paired-end reads. Sequencing was conducted at The Centre for Applied Genomics (Next Generation Sequencing Facility, SickKids Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada). The sequence reads from each sample were provided in a FASTQ file format. 10X Genomics long read Chromium sequencing was used to generate linked reads. The estimated genome size was thought to be similar to that of the eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) genome (2.82 Gb; Mead et al. 2020). We used FastQC (version 0.11.9; Andrews 2010) to perform simple quality control checks on raw sequence data to confirm the quality of the trimmed sequence reads. Long reads were assembled using Supernova as this assembler uses 10X linked-reads to produce phased assemblies of homologous chromosomes over multi-megabase ranges (Weisenfeld et al. 2018). The FASTA file representing the assembly was generated using the pseudohap style output. Assembly statistics were generated using BBMap 38.90 (Bushnell et al. 2017). We used BUSCO v 3.1.0 (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs; Waterhouse et al. 2018) and the mammalia odb9 dataset to reconstruct 4,104 conserved mammalian genes to assess genome completeness., Northern and southern flying squirrel libraries were prepared and paired-end sequenced across eight lanes on an Illumina HiSeq X to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. Sequencing was conducted at The Centre for Applied Genomics (Next Generation Sequencing Facility, SickKids Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada). Forward and reverse reads were concatenated across eight lanes. FastQC was run as above to determine forward and reverse read quality and inform subsequent trimming parameters. We trimmed the adapters and low-quality bases from the reads with Trimmomatic v0.39 and parameter specifications as follows: Illumina adapters were removed, leading and trailing low quality or N bases were removed (below quality 3), reads were scanned with a 4-base sliding window and cut when the average per quality base drops below 15, and reads were dropped that were less than 36 bases long after the previous step (Bolger et al. 2014). To avoid any potential contamination of the genome sequence with viral or bacterial sequences, we screened the trimmed reads with Kraken2 (Wood et al., 2019) using the full standard database., Reads from four individuals, including the individual used for the de novo assembly, (NFS_6525, NFS_50254, SFS_25428, and SFS_CC1) were aligned to the synthetic linked-read reference genome using Bowtie2 2.2.4 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012), and the SAM file was converted to a BAM file using Samtools 1.7 (Li et al. 2009). We removed poorly mapped reads via skipping alignments with MAPQ values smaller than 20 using Samtools 1.7. We removed duplicate reads and added correct read group information to each BAM file using Picard 2.18.27 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). We then clipped overlapping regions using clipOverlap from bamUtil 1.0.1.4 (Jun et al. 2015) and sorted the BAM file using Samtools 1.7 and built an index using Picard. All BAM files were checked using FastQC 0.11.9 (Andrews 2010), and we calculated the mean depth of coverage for each BAM file using Samtools. We used Haplotype Caller in gatk 3.8 (Mckenna et al. 2010) to call variants and produce a variant call format (VCF) file for each flying squirrel. Individual VCF files were combined using the Combine GVCFs function, and then, we performed joint genotyping using Genotype GVCFs, both in GATK, to produce a VCF file with both northern and southern flying squirrels. We did some additional filtering on the combined VCF files to ensure quality. We used VCFtools 0.1.16 (Danecek et al. 2011) to do two rounds of filtering. First, we removed indels (using the remove-indels command), and any site with a depth of less than five or more than 33 (approximately double the average depth across the genome, using the min-meanDP and max-meanDP commands) and removed any low-quality genotype calls, with a score below 20 (using the minGQ command), which in VCFtools are changed to missing data. In the second round, we filtered to remove genotypes with more than 10% missing data (using the max-missing command). We did not filter to remove any SNP with a minor allele frequency (MAF) as we have only one individual from each location and this results in removing the private sites, instead relying on very high depth and stringent filtering to ensure a high-quality data set., The combined VCF file used for analyses with all individuals contained 35,937,561 SNPs. After filtering, we measured the mean depth (using the depth command) and the frequency of missing data (using the missing-indv command) for each individual in the final VCF file of 2 northern and 2 southern flying squirrels using VCFtools., We identified and classified the repeat regions of the assembled genome using RepeatMasker v. 4.1.0 (Smit et al. 2013). We configured RepeatMasker with the RMBlast v. 2.10.0 sequence search engine, Tandem Repeat Finder v. 4.0.9 (Benson, 1999), Dfam_Consensus database 3.1 (November 2020 release), and used the “-species glaucomys” parameter for the analysis., We used the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS 2.5.5 (Hoff and Stanke 2019) to annotate the masked genome using predictions based on human genes. In addition, we incorporated RNA-Seq data into AUGUSTUS using the transcriptome created from brain tissue by Brown et al., (2021). We used BLAT v. 1.04 to help identify exon structure and allow for the subsequent generation of both intron and exon hints from alignments for AUGUSTUS (Hoff and Stanke 2019; http://augustus.gobics.de/binaries/readme.rnaseq.html). The genome run in AUGUSTUS used a partial gene model allowing the prediction of incomplete genes at the sequence boundaries. The masked genome was split into 31 parts of ∼1,995 sequences each to reduce the computational resources and we concatenated the 31 output general feature format (GFF) files into a single annotation file., To compare whole-genome heterozygosity estimates, we used ANGSD to generate a site frequency spectrum and obtain heterozygosity values for each individual. We used the parameters -C 50 -ref ref.fa -minQ 20 -minmapq 30 to remove the low-quality bases and reads (Korneliussen et al. 2014). We generated a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the degree of differentiation between these samples. We also ran Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC; Li and Durbin 2011) to model the historical effective population size and reconstruct the demographic history of both our northern and southern flying squirrel genomes. We used the default parameters of 64 atomic time intervals (-p “4 + 25*2 + 4 + 6”), a generation time of 1.5 years (COSEWIC 1998), and a mutation rate of m = 2.0 × 10−9 mutations/site/generation (Gossmann et al. 2019)., The final G. volans genome assembly was the untrimmed linked-read 10X Chromium assembly with Supernova (Weisenfeld et al. 2018), which produced a genome consisting of 7,087 scaffolds ≥50 Kb, a scaffold N50 of 455.26 Kb, a contig N50 of 75.63 Kb, a GC content of 40.48%, and a genome size of 2.40 Gb (Tables 1 and 2). Although the genome produced here is fragmented compared to the Earth BioGenome goals, future flying squirrel research will benefit greatly from the presence of a reference genome. BUSCO indicated the presence of 3,742 (91.2%) complete mammalian genes of the 4,104 searched for. Our estimated genome size was similar to the assembly of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus; ∼2.5 Gb), whereas the BUSCO value for the ground squirrel was 92.9% (Di Palma et al. 2011). Genome annotation of our final genome incorporating RNA-Seq data identified the locations of 19,124 protein-coding genes compared to 28,262 protein-coding genes without using RNA-Seq data.,  Summary statistics of the long read Glaucomys volans reference genome,  Summary statistics of the long read Glaucomys volans reference genome,  Nucleotide base composition of the long-read Glaucomys volans reference genome,  Nucleotide base composition of the long-read Glaucomys volans reference genome, Trimming the concatenated short read pairs resulted in the removal of an average of 4.37% of reads. The human library was removed from the full standard database, as its inclusion resulted in a relatively high percentage of reads mapped as human due to orthologous mammal genes. After removing the human library, 0.25–0.35% of the reads were classified as belonging to an identified bacterial taxon; screening trimmed concatenated short read pairs for bacterial contaminants resulted in the further removal of an average of 0.29% of reads. The final short read coverage for each of the four individuals were as follows: SFS_CC1 = 15.75X, SFS_25428 = 17.55X, NFS_50254 = 17.88X, and NFS_6525 = 14.96X. Our final VCF file contained 10% missing data. For all individuals, observed heterozygosity exceeded expected, while inbreeding coefficients ranged from 0.00261 to 0.00358 (NFS_50254 = 0.00276, NFS_6525 = 0.00261, SFS_CC1 = 0.00311, and SFS_25428 = 0.00358)., Northern and southern flying squirrels grouped distinctly in our PCA, while there was more variation among southern flying squirrels, possibly due to collection locations that were farther apart (Figure 2). The first principal component accounted for over 80% of the variation noted, and clearly separated both species. Both southern individuals had higher whole-genome heterozygosity relative to northern individuals. There are multiple possible explanations for this result. For example, southern flying squirrels are smaller-bodied and typically exhibit higher population sizes and densities, whereas a lower effective population size in northern flying squirrels may result in decreased heterozygosity (Arbogast 2007; Bowman et al. 2020). Overall, the levels of heterozygosity of both flying squirrel species that we observed were comparable to other genome-wide estimates in mammals (see Figure 3 in Morin et al. 2021)., PCA of two northern (G. sabrinus—represented in turquoise) and two southern (G. volans—represented in yellow) flying squirrel genomic variation. PC1 (x-axis) accounts for 81.2% of the variation, while PC2 (y-axis) accounts for 11.2% of the variation; combined, the first two principal components account for over 90% of the genomic variation., PCA of two northern (G. sabrinus—represented in turquoise) and two southern (G. volans—represented in yellow) flying squirrel genomic variation.

Dashed lines separate the individuals of the same species., Reconstruction of historical effective population size (Ne) of both northern (G. sabrinus—represented in turquoise) and southern (G. volans—represented in yellow) flying squirrels using PSMC analysis assuming a mutation rate µ of 2.0 × 10−9 mutations/site/generation and a generation time of 1.5 years. Ne is in units of 1,000 individuals on the y-axis and time measured in thousands of years ago (Kya) is on the x-axis. Dashed lines separate the individuals of the same species., Previous research has estimated the split between northern and southern flying squirrels to be in the early to mid-Pleistocene (2,580,000–130,000 years ago; Arbogast 1999, 2007). Based on PSMC analysis, the split between the species seemed to occur approximately 1mya, whereas, after 1mya, the species exhibited different trajectories (Figure 3). The demographic reconstruction of one northern flying squirrel (NFS_6525) showed an increase in recent effective population size relative to the other northern individual (NFS_50254; Figure 3). It is possible that the demographic history of NFS_50254 more closely resembles that of the southern flying squirrel samples. However, it is also possible that technical biases resulted in this pattern (e.g., relatively low sequencing coverage for NFS_6525), as PSMC is less accurate in the recent past and is susceptible to an increase in effective population size as seen in our data (e.g., Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2016). Previous work using microsatellites has been consistent with panmixia in Ontario within each of these species (Garroway et al. 2011; Bowman et al. 2020). To address introgression and hybridization concerns, future research can utilize the reference genome produced here to perform analyses with a larger sample of genomes with varying degrees of introgression to help clarify these patterns., We produced a high-quality southern flying squirrel reference genome, an annotation in gff3 and bed format, and a RepeatMasked version of the genome, as well as high-coverage northern and southern flying squirrel re-sequenced genomes. The availability of a high-quality reference genome is invaluable in answering evolutionary questions surrounding hybridization and introgression and for conservation efforts. This is the first flying squirrel genome generated and will help future research determine not only the presence of hybrids in the North American flying squirrel hybrid zone but can also aid in identifying loci of interest in these same populations., 10X Chromium long-read and Illumina short-read data are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), under the BioProject accession number PRJNA723586.

Our study also suggests for the first time in flatfishes that a putative Y-autosomal fusion could be associated with a reduction of recombination typical of the early steps of sex chromosome evolution., The mechanisms underlying sex determination (SD) are known to affect developmental processes, the evolution of genomes, and are responsible for determining sex ratio, a key demographic parameter for population viability and stability (Bull 1983; Uller et al. 2007). In recent years, genetic analyses in nonmodel species have revealed a greater degree of sex chromosome diversity and turnover than previously appreciated (Abbott et al. 2016). In fact, many case studies in different taxonomic groups, including lizards, fish, amphibians, insects, and plants show frequent changes in the location of SD genes and high rates of turnover of sex chromosomes, suggesting that exceptions are the rules in sex determination (Yano et al. 2013; McGrath 2020, for review). Therefore, a more cyclical than linear conceptual framework could be used to explain the evolution of sex chromosomes (Bachtrog 2006; Furman et al. 2020). In such a cycle, a new master sex-determining locus arises on an autosome, leading to sex chromosome formation, generally characterized by recombination suppression between the Y and X, or the Z and W chromosomes. As under a classic sex chromosome evolution model, this situation may progress toward increased divergence between male and female chromosomes, leading to chromosome heteromorphism characterized by genomic degradation, including rearrangements and loss of genetic material (Charlesworth et al. 2005; Bachtrog 2013). However, sex chromosomes and sex-determining regions can also undergo turnover with either the evolution of a new sex-determining gene or the transposition of the sex-determining gene to a new location in the genome, leading to another cycle of sex chromosome evolution (Bachtrog 2006). The increasing availability of high-quality genome assemblies in nonmodel taxonomic groups is now providing exciting opportunities to revisit the evolution of genetic SD (Whibley et al. 2021)., Fish exhibit a remarkable plasticity in gonad development and a high evolutionary SD turnover, making them a particularly relevant group to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes (Kitano and Peichel 2012). Fish display highly diverse chromosome SD systems, including models analogous to the XX/XY (male heterogametic) and ZZ/ZW (female heterogametic) systems of mammals and birds, respectively, but also other systems involving multiple sex chromosomes (Capel 2017). In accordance with this rapid turnover, chromosome heteromorphism is rare in fishes (e.g., Pan et al. 2019; Martinez et al. 2021), which generally show limited sex chromosome differentiation (Chen et al. 2014), characteristic of early SD mechanisms or frequent sex determination transitions than can be identified even between populations of the same species (e.g., Pan et al. 2021). Until recently, the DM-domain gene on the Y chromosome (dmy) was the only known gene coding for a functional protein in the Y-specific chromosome region (Nanda et al. 2002; Kondo et al. 2006) and was described as the controlling SD gene in a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates, including fish. However, thanks to new genomics tools, the genomic features underlying SD have been more intensively studied and several other strong candidates of controlling SD genes have been found in fish, including amhy, gsdf, amhr2, and sdY (Guerrero-Estévez and Moreno-Mendoza 2010; Yano et al. 2013; Rondeau et al. 2016; Hattori et al. 2019; Pan et al. 2019). In fact, three of these genes (amhy, amhr2, and gsdf) are involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, while the sdY, dmrt1, and dmy genes code for transcription factors (Rastetter et al. 2015). Unsuspected SD mechanisms are also being unraveled. For example, a recent study in Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) identified the breast cancer anti-resistance 1 (BCAR1) gene as the controlling SD candidate (Bao et al. 2019). Insights into SD genomics go beyond controlling genes in fish, as several studies have documented, and include mixed determination involving both genetic and environmental factors, polygenic SD systems, extensive within-species variation in SD system, and complex rearrangements of sex chromosomes favoring species diversification (Baroiller et al. 2009; Martinez et al. 2014; Capel 2017). With such dynamism and variability in fish sex chromosome evolution, we need improved genomic resources in nonmodel species, including chromosome-scale reference genomes and whole-genome sequences from both sexes, to improve our understanding of the subject., In exploited species, improved genomic resources and the understanding of the genetic basis for SD is also relevant to improve fisheries management in the face of increasing demand for seafood worldwide and to secure the economies and livelihoods that depend on them (Bernatchez et al. 2017). Genomic approaches allow investigating genome-wide diversity and accurately identifying genetically distinct fish stocks (Ovenden et al. 2013). Moreover, accounting for sex-differentiation and sex-linked loci is necessary to avoid unexpected biases due to sex-associated markers (Benestan et al. 2017) and to consider variation in sex-ratio in management practices. This is particularly true for species harboring a size-related sexual dimorphism, like flatfish species, that generally favors larger females. Example species are the European Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa; Rljnsdorp and Ibelings 1989), the Turbot (Scotphtalmus maximus; Imsland et al. 1997), and the Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus; Hagen et al. 2006). Sex control identification is of high importance for both flatfish production in aquaculture and sustainable fisheries. The selection of large individuals is a well-established concept in fisheries management that increases yield per recruit. However, in the case of sexual dimorphism, fisheries targeting large individuals may reduce the stock’s reproductive potential, produce biases in the assessment of the number of reproductive females, and feed erroneous data to fisheries management decision-makers (Keyl et al. 2015). Overall, both applied and fundamental evolutionary biology thus benefit from moving beyond genetic markers toward contiguous reference genomes annotated for functional elements and documented for SD., Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the main exploited demersal fish in Eastern Canada (Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, and the Arctic), representing around 4000 tons of landings per year across the two last decades (DFO 2018). However, the management of Greenland Halibut fisheries would benefit from improved genomic resources. Indeed, no karyotype, linkage map nor genome assembly has been developed for this species so far. Given that juvenile growth potential and size are sexually dimorphic in this species (Ghinter et al. 2019), it is valuable to better understand the sex-determining mechanisms to control sex imbalance in catches. Moreover, the recent genome assemblies of other flatfish species (Figure 1, Table 1; Chen et al. 2014; Figueras et al. 2016; Robledo et al. 2017; Shao et al. 2017; Einfeldt et al. 2021) together with studies on sex-determining loci in this taxon (Chen et al. 2014; Drinan et al. 2018; Liang et al. 2018; Einfeldt et al. 2021) provide an opportunity to investigate the evolutionary turnover of sex chromosomes and SD systems. Flatfishes studied so far are characterized by a variable heterogametic system and different sex-determining genes. For instance, a similar female heterogametic system (ZZ/ZW) is found both in the Tongue Sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and the Turbot but the candidate SD drivers differ, being sox2 in the latter (Martinez et al. 2021; Table 1), and dmrt1 in the former species (Chen et al. 2014). Japanese Flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (also called the Olive Flounder) has an XX/XY system (Liang et al. 2018) but no sex determining gene has been found (Shao et al. 2017) and the environment is known to alter sex differentiation in this species (Ospina-Alvarez and Piferrer 2008). Within the righteye flounder family (Pleuronectidae), the Hippoglossinae subfamiliy harbors variable genetic SD systems. The Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) has a ZZ/ZW system and several sex-linked loci aligned in three different linkage groups (Drinan et al. 2018) while its sister-species, the Atlantic Halibut (H. hippoglossus), has a XX/XY system and a putative SD factor called gsdf on chromosome 12 (Palaiokostas et al. 2013; Einfeldt et al. 2021)., Phylogenetic relationships and syntenic distances between important flatfish species in fisheries and aquaculture.

We produced the first chromosome-level genome assembly for this species by combining single-molecule sequencing of long reads (Pacific Sciences) with chromatin conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) data. Furthermore, we also identified and characterized the molecular SD system by mapping whole genome sequencing data of 198 individuals onto the assembly to screen for genetic markers that diverged between sexes. Finally, in order to provide an estimate of the extent of rearrangements between species, we analyzed our results in a comparative genomic framework by assessing synteny (i.e., blocks of genes found in the same order in the genome) with other species of flatfish and by targeting candidate sex-determining genes in this group., We built a reference genome assembly for the Greenland Halibut in two steps. First, we created a draft assembly using the PacBio long-reads sequencing approach (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and we then applied Dovetail™ Hi-C (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009), from Dovetail Genomics to increase contiguity, break up mis-joins, and orient and join scaffolds into chromosomes., The individual whose DNA was used to assemble the reference was a juvenile female caught in the St. Lawrence River Estuary (48°39′11″N, 68°28′37″W) with a Commando-type bottom trawl aboard the CCGS Leim [Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) survey] at the end of May 2016 and kept alive in controlled environmental conditions at the Maurice Lamontagne Institute (IML), Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Ghinter et al. 2019). The female was anesthetized for 5 min in a 0.18 g L−1 MS-222 solution (tricaine methane sulfonate; Sigma -Aldrich Co, MI, USA). Blood was then sampled from the caudal artery using a 23-gauge needle in a 1 ml TB syringe (Becton, Dickinson & Co., NJ, USA), both of which were previously heparinized in a 100 U ml−1 heparin solution. Blood was immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until DNA extraction. Multiple tissues including liver, muscle, heart, brain, eye, gonads, gall bladder, and kidney were then excised from the fish, flash-frozen, and stored at −80°C until further transcriptomic analyses., High molecular weight DNA was extracted from flash-frozen blood using the Qiagen MagAttract kit, (Valencia, CA, USA). Then a library was created using the SMRTbell Template Prep kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), which incorporates size selection and DNA damage repair steps. We obtained fragments of >10 kb using size selection with a Blue Pippin instrument (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol for 20 kb template preparation. Five micrograms of concentrated DNA was then used as input for the library preparation reaction. Library quality and quantity were assessed using the Pippin Pulse field inversion gel electrophoresis system (Sage Science), as well as with the dsDNA Broad Range Assay kit and Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Single-Molecule Real Time sequencing was performed on the Pacific Biosciences RS II instrument at McGill University using an on-plate concentration of 125 pM, P6-C4 sequencing chemistry, with magnetic bead loading and 360-min movies. A total of 14 SMRT Cells were run, generating a mean sequence coverage of ∼70-fold, with half of the sequences contained in reads longer than 10.6 kb. An initial assembly was carried out on the PacBio long reads using Wtdbg v2.5 (-x sq gg 0.7 g; Ruan and Li 2020), resulting in 2037 contigs (scaffold N50 = 3.17 Mb), for a total assembly size of 598.5 Mb. One Hi-C proximity ligation library was generated from a flash-frozen piece of muscle of the same individual using the Dovetail’s™ Hi-C Kit v.1.0. This kit employs the restriction enzyme DpnII which recognizes the sequence 5'/GATC 3'. The long-range library was then sent to Dovetail Genomics to be sequenced and run with the initial PacBio assembly through Dovetail’s HiRiseTM scaffolding pipeline. The completeness of the final assembly was assessed with BUSCO v 4.0.5 (Simão et al. 2015), the eukaryota_odb10 database (created in October 2020) and the -m genome option. The occurrence of repeat elements in our assembly as well as in Atlantic and Pacific Halibut was assessed using RepeatMasker v.4.0.6 (Smit et al. 2013–2015)., Synteny blocks between the genomes of Greenland Halibut and other flatfish species for which a reference genome is available (Tongue Sole, Turbot, and Japanese Flounder as well as Atlantic and Pacific Halibut) were computed using SyMAP v4.2 (Soderlund et al. 2011). Genomic sequences were first aligned using promer/MUMmer (Kurtz et al. 2004). Raw anchors resulting from MUMmer were clustered into (putative) gene anchors, filtered using a reciprocal top-2 filter and used as input to the synteny algorithm (Soderlund et al. 2006). The algorithm constructs maximal-scoring anchor chains based on a given gap penalty. It also searches a range of gap penalties to generate the longest chains subject to several quality criteria, which are based on the Pearson correlation coefficient applied to the anchors in the chain as well as the anchors in its bounding box. The chains are not required to be entirely colinear and may incorporate local inversions relative to the overall chain orientation. Results stemming from the synteny analysis were visualized using the chromosome explorer and the circle view options in SyMAP v4.2. Finally, we named scaffolds by mapping our assembly to the Pacific Halibut assembly (IPHC_HiSten_1.0, GenBank accession: GCA_013339905.1)., In order to annotate the reference assembly, total RNA from eight different tissues (liver, muscle, heart, brain, eye, gonads, gall bladder, and kidney) from the same individual was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen then treated using DNase I, Amplification Grade (1 unit per μl; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration of each tissue was quantified with Quant-iT™ RiboGreen® RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and fragment size distribution was estimated with an Agilent BioAnalyzer before being shipped to the Génome Québec Centre d’Expertise et de Services (Montréal, Canada) to prepare libraries and perform sequencing. One RNA-seq library was constructed for each tissue using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced with a 2 × 100bp (paired-end) read module using the 6000, generating 50M reads., For each of the eight paired-end tissue-specific RNAseq datasets, raw reads were trimmed with trimmomatic (v0.36, ILLUMINACLIP: univec.fasta: 2:20:7, LEADING: 20, TRAILING: 20, SLIDINGWINDOW: 30:30, MINLEN: 80). The tissue-specific paired-end datasets were then each assembled separately using Trinity (v2.1.1, –seqType fq, –min_contig_length 200) to produce 8 assembled transcriptomes that contained between 68,481 and 276,168, with a mean of 131,038, assembled expressed sequences. The 1,048,307 assembled expressed sequences were used to annotate the assembled genome using the GAWN pipeline v0.3.4 (https://github.com/enormandeau/gawn). The annotations were then simplified by using the simplify_genome_annotation_table.py script (included in the GAWN pipeline), which removes consecutive almost-identical annotations from the genome annotation table., A total of 432 Greenland Halibut were sampled aboard the R/V Paamiut, from October to November 2016, as part of the annual multispecies survey conducted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subarea 0 in Davis Strait, Canada. Fish were lethally sampled in order to collect length, weight, phenotypic sex, and maturity information. A fin-clip was taken from each individual for genetic analysis. From those individuals, 99 females and 99 males have been selected for sex determination analysis (see sample selection details in Supplementary Material)., Toward this end, we performed the low coverage whole genome sequencing approach proposed by Therkildsen and Palumbi (2017). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from a fin-clip using a salt-extraction protocol (Aljanabi and Martinez 1997) with a RNase A treatment (Qiagen). DNA quality of each extract was evaluated with Nanodrop 2000 (ThermoFisher scientific) and migration on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Following Therkildsen and Palumbi (2017), we removed DNA fragments shorter than 1 kb by treating each extract with Axygen magnetic beads in a 0.4:1 ratio, and eluted the DNA in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. We measured DNA concentrations with the Accuclear ultra high sensitivity dsDNA quantification kit (Biotium) and normalized all samples at a concentration of 5 ng/μl. Then, sample DNA extracts were randomized, distributed in plates (96 -well see details about randomization and number of plates used in Supplementary Material) and re-normalized at 2 ng/μl., Whole-genome high-quality libraries were prepared for each sample according to the protocol described in (Baym et al. 2015; Therkildsen and Palumbi 2017). Briefly, a tagmentation reaction using enzyme from the Nextera DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina), which simultaneously fragments the DNA and incorporates partial adapters, was carried out in a 2.5 μl volume with approximately 2 ng of input DNA. Then, we used a two-step PCR procedure with a total of 12 cycles (8 + 4) to add the remaining Illumina adapter sequence with dual index barcodes and to amplify the libraries. The PCR was conducted with the KAPA Library Amplification Kit and custom primers derived from Nextera XT barcode sets A, B, C, and D (total of 384 possible combinations). Amplification products were purified from primers and size-selected with a two-steps Axygen magnetic beads cleaning protocol, first with a ratio 0.5:1, keeping the supernatant (medium and short DNA fragments), second with a ratio 0.75:1, keeping the beads (medium fragments). Final concentrations of the libraries were quantified with the Accuclear ultra high sensitivity dsDNA quantification kit (Biotium) and fragment size distribution was estimated with an Agilent BioAnalyzer for a subset of 10–20 samples per plate. Finally, libraries were pooled (see details in Supplementary Material) for sequence lanes of paired-end 150 bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at the Norwegian Sequencing Center at the University of Oslo. Given our multiplexing (up to 96 individuals per lane) and genome size (∼ 600 Mb), we targeted a low sequencing coverage around 1.26 X., Raw reads were trimmed, filtered for quality, mapped to the reference genome (obtained above), cleaned for duplicate reads and mapping quality and then re-aligned using the pipeline available at https://github.com/enormandeau/wgs_sample_preparation, inspired by Therkildsen and Palumbi (2017) and fully described in Mérot et al. (2021). Given the high percentage of the assembly comprised into the anchored 24 chromosomes (>96%, see results section), raw reads were mapped against a reduced version of the genome including only the 24 chromosomes and excluding the unassembled scaffolds. A preliminary analysis, in which individual reads were mapped to the full genome did not change the outcome of the results., For low coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) data, the recommended practice is to avoid basing downstream analysis on called genotypes (Nielsen et al. 2011) and to instead use a probabilistic approach based on Genotype Likelihoods. Several models for computing genotype-likelihood-based on read data have been implemented in the program ANGSD (Korneliussen et al. 2014) and it is currently the most widely used and versatile software package for the analysis of lcWGS (Lou et al. 2021). Therefore, ANGSD v0.931 was used for most of our subsequent analyses according to the pipeline documentation available at https://github.com/clairemerot/angsd_pipeline. For all analyses, input reads were filtered to remove reads with a samtools flag above 255 (not primary, failure and duplicate reads, tag -remove_bads = 1), with mapping quality below 30 (-minMapQ 30) and to remove bases with quality below 20 (-minQ 20). We also filtered in order to keep only SNPs covered by at least one read in at least 30% of individuals (-minInd 60) and remove SNPs in putative repeated regions allowing a maximum depth of 3 times the number of individuals (-setMaxDepth 594). Finally, for most of the subsequent analyses (unless mentioned otherwise) we kept SNPs with minor allele frequency above 5%., First, we ran ANGSD to estimate genotype likelihoods (GL) with the GATK model (-doGlf 2 -GL 2 -doCounts 1), the spectrum of allele frequency (-doSaf 1) and the minor allele frequency (-doMaf 1) options. The major allele was based on the genotype likelihood and was the most frequent allele (-doMajorMinor 1). From this first analysis, we generated (1) a beagle file with GL estimates and (2) a list of variants passing those filters and their respective major and minor alleles that were used for most subsequent analysis. The R program (R Core Team 2020) was employed for graphic output in subsequent analyses, via the package ggplot (Wickham 2016)., Total depth along the entire genome was calculated using the function -doDepth 1 in ANGSD, excluding high coverage (-setMaxDepth 594 and -maxDepth 1000) and low coverage regions (-minInd 60), along with the following arguments for depth: -dumpCounts 2 -doCounts 1. Depth was then averaged across sliding windows of 25 Kb with 5 Kb steps using the winScan function of the R package windowscanr (Tavares 2021). The sliding approach allowed us to visualize individual coverage along the genome, while a ratio of total depth of females above total depth of males was also plotted using ggplot. This ratio is expected to deviate from 1 in genomic regions in which a sex-bias in coverage exists., Genome-wide variation across samples was explored using PCAangsd (Meisner and Albrechtsen 2018) on the genotype likelihoods. This program extracts a covariance matrix that is then decomposed into the principal component analysis (PCA) with R, using a scaling 2 transformation adding an eigenvalues correction, to obtain the individuals PC scores (Legendre and Legendre 1998)., In order to identify the genomic regions involved in sex differentiation, two analyses were performed. First, we ran local PCAs (Li and Ralph 2018) with PCAangsd on genotype likelihoods in nonoverlapping windows of 1000 SNPs in each chromosome to extract local covariance matrices and obtained local PCAs of genomic variation (as detailed above). For each local PCA, we analyzed the correlation between the PC1 score and PC scores from the global PCA performed on the entire genome. The resulting correlation indices were then plotted across their relative position in each chromosome. Second, genome-wide Fst was estimated between males and females. To do this, allele frequency spectrum (-doSaf 1) and minor allele frequencies were calculated for each sex with the previous list of variant positions (-sites) and their polarization as major or minor alleles (-doMajorMinor 3). Genome-wide Fst was estimated using the realSFS function in ANGSD between males and females and then summarized across sliding-windows of 25 Kb with a step of 5 Kb. Observed heterozygosity was computed for each sex and each SNP using the function -doHWE in ANGSD and then averaged across sliding-windows of 25 Kb with a step of 5 Kb using the winScan function of the R package windowscanr., For the two chromosomes associated with sex determination (see results below), intra-chromosomal as well as inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated within each sex for a reduced number of SNPs, filtered with more stringent criteria (MAF > 10%, at least one read in 75% of the samples). Pairwise R2 were calculated using ngsLD (Fox et al. 2019) based on genotype likelihood reported in the beagle file obtained previously. The 10th percentile of pairwise R2 values was averaged across windows of 250 Kb and plotted for each sex using custom scripts available at https://github.com/clairemerot/angsd_pipeline. Then changes in LD along the sex identified chromosomes were analyzed by calculating mean R2 for males and females separately., To localize orthologous genes of previously identified sex-associated genes in our assembly, we aligned all sex-associated markers from Drinan et al. (2018) as well as others previously described to have a SD effect in flatfish and some other teleost species, to our reference assembly using LAST v.1179 (Kiełbasa et al. 2011; see Supplementary Table S1 for details about those genes and their accession number)., We generated a final genome assembly of 598.5 Mb with high contiguity (contig N50 = 3.1 Mb, scaffold N50 = 25 Mb, scaffold N90 = 20 Mb), of which 96.35% is comprised in 24 chromosome-length scaffolds (GenBank accession: GCA_006182925.3). These 24 scaffolds are consistent with the number of diploid chromosomes (2n = 48) for Atlantic Halibut (Einfeldt et al. 2021) and Pacific Halibut (GCA_013339905.1). The Hi-C data supported a high degree of accuracy in the overall assembly into these 24 scaffolds, as indicated by the strong concentration of data points along the diagonal rather than elsewhere in the contact maps (Supplementary Figure S1). Altogether, this suggests that these 24 scaffolds can be considered as chromosomes. The completeness of the assembly based on single-copy orthologs across eukaryotes was 98.04%, with 96.47% complete and single copy orthologs and 1.57% duplication., There were 60,313 transcripts detected from multi-tissue transcriptomics data, with 97.7% of them (58,908 transcripts) within the 24 anchored chromosomes. A total of 19,252 genes and pseudogenes were annotated, of which 19,053 (99%) were located within the 24 chromosomes (Supplementary Table S2). Repeated elements accounted for 8.20% of chromosome lengths (49.1 Mb). These measures of completeness and assessments of repeat elements in Greenland Halibut were highly concordant with the statistics obtained from Atlantic and Pacific Halibut as well as the three other flatfish species with reference genome and important for fisheries and/or aquaculture production (Table 1). SyMap revealed shared syntenic blocks with other flatfish species (Table 2 and Figure 1). Most of the chromosomes harbor a single syntenic block compared with the most closely related Hippoglossinae, the Pacific Halibut (16 out of 24 chromosomes), and the Atlantic Halibut (15/24). In contrast, mapping with the three other flatfish species displayed several syntenic blocks for all chromosomes (Table 2). As a result, syntenic blocks were larger with Pacific and Atlantic Halibut than with the three other flatfishes (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2). Supplementary Figure S2 displays this negative relationship between the size of syntenic blocks and phylogenetic distance., Syntenic relations between Greenland Halibut and related commercial flatfish species, Syntenic relations between Greenland Halibut and related commercial flatfish species, By generating this chromosome-level genome assembly for Greenland Halibut, among the most contiguous of flatfish assemblies to date, we provide a genomic resource for this unique species of the genus Reinhardtius. This reference genome will now become a fundamental tool to understand the genomic variability of Greenland Halibut in the context of comparative genomics and fisheries applications., After mapping the reads of 99 male and ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9 female Greenland Halibut samples to the reference genome, cleaning for quality and processing for SNP identification with genotype likelihoods, we identified 7,301,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allelic frequency (MAF) above 5%. These SNPs were then used for further analyses pertaining to sex differentiation., Genome-wide variation analyzed by a global PCA displayed two clusters corresponding to males and females on PC1, which explained 5.7% of the genetic variance (Supplementary Figure S4). Local PCAs on windows of 1000 SNPs along the genome revealed that this sex differentiation was mainly explained by genetic variation on two chromosomes (Chr10 and Chr21, Figure 2A). The correlation between the 1st PC of the global PCA and each local PCA was very low at the very beginning of each of those two chromosomes but increased rapidly along both chromosomes. A large portion of each of these two chromosomes explains the total genetic variation observed between the two sexes in PC1. Particularly, the last 66.5% of Chr10 (16.5 Mb out of 24.8 Mb) and 52.2% of Chr21 (10.5 Mb out of 20.1 Mb) explained more than 90% of the sex differentiation observed on global PC1 (Figure 2B). Genome-wide Fst estimations between males and females corroborate this result revealing high differentiation on Chr10 and Chr21 (Figure 2C). While the mean genome-wide Fst between the sexes is as low as 0.01, Chr10 and Chr21 harbored a large region with higher Fst values with a mean Fst of 0.21 and 0.15, respectively (Figure 2D). Few localized peaks of sex differentiation were also observed on Chr9, Chr11, Chr12, Chr13, and Chr15 (Figure 2B)., Two genomic regions implied in sex differentiation. (A) Correlation between PC1 scores of the local PCAs performed on windows of 1000 SNPs and PC1 scores of the global PCA along with their genomic position in each chromosome.

Vertical dashed gray lines indicate the positions of detected sex-related candidate genes., The observed proportion of heterozygotes followed the same pattern, with similar values between males and females across most of the genome (Figure 2E), but with a much higher fraction of heterozygotes in males than females in the two major regions previously described. This difference between males and females was more pronounced in Chr10 than in Chr21. Both Chr10 and Chr21 were also characterized by strong LD, which was markedly higher in males than in females (Figure 3), suggesting lower recombination rate in males than females for these genomic regions., Intra- and Interchromosomal LD among males and females, revealing a putative Y-autosomal fusion. The color scale corresponds to the 10th highest percentile of the R2 value of each SNP pairwise summarized by windows of 250 Kb. Male values are displayed above the diagonal and female values are displayed below the diagonal. Positions are represented in megabases., Intra- and Interchromosomal LD among males and females, revealing a putative Y-autosomal fusion. The color scale corresponds to the 10th highest percentile of the R2 value of each SNP pairwise summarized by windows of 250 Kb. Male values are displayed above the diagonal and female values are displayed below the diagonal. Positions are represented in megabases., In contrast with differentiation and heterozygosity, coverage did not differ between males and females, neither genome-wide nor in regions of sex differentiation (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that Greenland Halibut is not harboring sex chromosome heteromorphism. Moreover, the putative sex chromosomes Chr10 and Chr21 have apparently not undergone degradation, which could be either typical of early SD systems or the result of an older system that has sex chromosome turnover as found in other fish species (see below)., Altogether, these results point toward a major role of Chr10 and Chr21 in genetic sex determination. The higher heterozygosity and LD in males suggest that Greenland Halibut is characterized by a XX/XY sex determination mechanism. The putative male Y chromosome exhibits two characteristics of sex chromosome evolution: it is divergent from the X chromosome and exhibits a reduction of recombination. However, it does not appear degraded, suggesting either very nascent sex chromosome at an early evolutionary stage or resulting from the high evolutionary lability of SD in teleost fish. This is corroborated by the syntenic relationships with closely related flatfish species which indicate that homologs of Chr10 and Chr21 are autosome chromosomes. Chr10 and Chr21 neither correspond to locations where sex-determining regions have been defined in other flatfish species (Figure 1, Table 1, and Supplementary Figure S3). Overall, the resolved sex-determining system in Greenland Halibut is highly consistent with the rapid turnover of sex chromosomes in fish, particularly in flatfish, given that the Atlantic Halibut has also undergone a recent evolution of an XY SD mechanism (Einfeldt et al. 2021)., Observing high sex differentiation and characteristics of sex chromosome evolution on two different chromosomes was unexpected and puzzling. The Hi-C contact map very strongly supported that Chr10 and Chr21 are distinct chromosomes in the specimen used for the assembly, a juvenile female (Supplementary Figure S1). Inter-chromosomal LD was also low in females, confirming the independent segregation of Chr10 and Chr21. Conversely, LD between Chr10 and Chr21 was very high in males (Figure 3), suggesting that the male haplotypes of those two chromosomes segregate together. One possible mechanism explaining such pattern would be a male-restricted fusion between the Y chromosome and one autosome. Chromosome fission and fusion events are frequent in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly in fish, in which they could explain the enormous species richness and rapid evolution of karyotypes (Cheng et al. 2020; Sutherland et al. 2017). Fusions may also be polymorphic in fish and play an adaptive role, as reported in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), in which fused and unfused karyotypes have been shown to coexist (Lehnert et al. 2019; Wellband et al. 2019). Moreover, fusions between a Y chromosome and an autosome are known to occur more frequently than autosomal fusions or W-autosome fusions, particularly in fishes (Pennell et al. 2015). The most probable explanation for the preponderance of Y-autosome fusions involves both selection and sex biases, as the smallest effective size (Ne) of the Y makes it more likely to fix rearrangements, including those with partially deleterious effects. This process may be even more prevalent in species with polygynous mating system like fish, which increases the variance of male reproductive success, as well as in species with skewed sex-ratios, such as the Greenland Halibut (Ghinter et al. 2019). Because of its significant impact on recombination, chromosomal fusion may be one of the key factors underlying the evolution of differentiated sex chromosomes. Fusions are a peculiar class of rearrangements that not only link chromosomes that previously segregated independently but also reduce recombination rates within each arm and prevent recombination between fused and unfused homologous chromosomes in polymorphic populations (Dumas and Britton-Davidian 2002). This typically leads to gradual differentiation from the fusion point as observed here for Greenland Halibut or for the young sex chromosomes found in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Kitano et al. 2009). This represents a typical step in the birth and establishment of new sex chromosomes (McAllyster 2003; Kirkpatrick 2010), often mediated via large chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions or fusions. One of the main determinants of this process is selection against recombination, because linkage between SD loci and alleles beneficial to one sex has the potential to resolve sexual conflict (Charlesworth et al. 2005). As discussed below, we identified three sex-associated loci distributed on two chromosomes and one may speculate whether epistatic interactions may occur between them and putative other candidates not identified in this study. Further work would be needed to better understand gene interactions in this region and more formally confirm the putative male-limited fusion (Guerrero and Kirkpatrick 2014; Wright et al. 2016)., Alignment of DNA or mRNA sequences of previously described sex-associated markers revealed that several putative gene candidate drivers of SD were distributed throughout Greenland Halibut assembly (on seven chromosomes, Supplementary Table S1). Most of those genes are located in regions of low differentiation between males and females: amhr2, cyp19a1A on chr05; cyp11b2 and rspo1 on chr08; dmrt1 on chr09, foxl2 on chr10 and gsdf on chr18, making them unlikely to underlie sex differentiation in Greenland Halibut. However, three candidate genes mapped to the putative sex chromosomes: gdf6 and sox2 on Chr10, and sox9a2 on Chr21 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1) and are thus candidate drivers of SD in Greenland Halibut., Growth differentiation factor 6 (Gdf6) is a member of the TGF-β family involved in vertebral segmentation and cell differentiation. While no gonadal function was reported previously, gdf6Y emerged recently as a putative SD gene in the Turquoise Killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) (Reichwald et al. 2015) because sex-linked allelic variations were found to affect the Gdf6 protein function. The Y chromosome allele, gdf6Y, also exhibits sex-linked expression during testicular differentiation in the Turquoise Killifish, supporting its SD role but functional evidence of its role as a SD gene is yet not available., Sox2 is a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family with a high-mobility-group (HMG) DNA-binding domain (Zhang and Cui 2014). It is an important transcription factor, which is involved in developmental processes of vertebrates, such as embryogenesis, maintenance of stem cells, and neurogenesis. In the Rohu Carp (Labeo rohita), sox2 mRNA is expressed in various organs, as well as in the culture proliferating spermatogonial stem cells (Patra et al. 2015). Sox2 is also a candidate SD gene in two aquaculture species, the mollusk Zhikong Scallop (Chlamys varia) (Liang et al. 2019) and the crustacean Black Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon) (Guo et al. 2019). In flatfishes, sox2 is also a strong candidate for SD. For instance, in Japanese Flounder sox2 is expressed in gonadal tissues and the transcript abundance in ovaries is higher than in testis (Gao et al. 2014). In Turbot, sox2 is defined as a consistent candidate gene putatively driving SD (Martinez et al. 2021)., The Sox9 gene has been related to sexual differentiation in several teleost species: Rainbow Trout, (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Takamatsu et al. 1997; Vizziano et al. 2007), Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, Ijiri et al. 2008), Zebrafish (Danio rerio; Chiang et al., 2001; von Hofsten and Olsson 2005), Medaka, Oryzias latipes (Yokoi et al. 2002), Guppy (Poecilia reticul, Shen et al. 2007), the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio, Du et al. 2007), and the Asian Swamp Eel (Monopterus albus, Zhou et al. 2003). In the Rainbow Trout, two sox9 genes have been identified: sox9a1 and sox9a2. Sox9a1 shows higher expression levels in males than in females before sexual differentiation (Vizziano et al. 2007). In Tilapia, sox9 expression is similar in XX and XY gonads, but, after sexual differentiation, it is positively regulated in XY gonads (Ijiri et al. 2008). In Medaka, testicular sox9 (sox9a2) expression in somatic cells is similar in both sexes during early gonadal differentiation and becomes positively regulated in males during the testicular lobe formation stage (Nakamoto et al. 2005). Overall, these observations support the hypothesis of a significant role for sox9 in either testicular differentiation or testicular development. This gene may also be performing a similar function in flatfish. In Atlantic Halibut, sox9a2 is included in a cascade of gene activation starting with the dmrt1 gene which is activated by the putative SD factor, the gsdf gene (Norris and Carr 2013; Einfeldt et al. 2021)., In Greenland Halibut, sox2, gdf6, and sox9a2 represent three possible candidate genes for sex determination. One can think that these three genes may be interacting in shaping the determination of sex and/or the subsequent development of sex organs. In addition, it is not excluded that some genes located in the highest peaks of differentiation but currently not included in the search neither in the annotation, and thus not identified by our study, could also have an effect on sex differentiation in Greenland Halibut and/or interact with current identified candidates., SD genes identified in the two most closely related flatfish species, Atlantic and Pacific Halibut (Table 1), do not appear to differentiate male and female Greenland Halibut. This is somewhat unsurprising given that even within the same genus (Hyppoglossus), not only do different species have different genes driving SD, but they also harbor a different heterogametic sex chromosome system (XY for Atlantic Halibut and ZW for Pacific Halibut, Drinan et al. 2018; Einfeldt et al. 2021)., The identified SD system with low differentiation between sex chromosomes revealed in Greenland Halibut might reflect the observed complex and still enigmatic sex maturation. For example, in some Greenland Halibut individuals the maturation cycle can be interrupted by a sudden degeneration of the oocytes (Fedorov 1971). More recently, it has been suggested that this species utilizes a very unusual oocyte development pattern containing two simultaneously developing cohorts of vitellogenic oocytes, not seen in any related species (Rideout et al. 2012; Dominguez-Petit et al. 2018). Also, Greenland Halibut present high densities and regular occurrence of rodlet cells in male and female gonads, which is unusual and still unexplained (Rideout et al. 2015). Furthermore, environmental factors such as temperature, pH, population density, and social interactions have all been found to influence the sex-ratio in fish (Crews 1976; Nakamura et al. 1998; Baroiller et al. 2009) and we cannot rule out a possible role of such factors. Clearly, more research is needed to better disentangle the relative contributions of environmental and genetic factors in SD in Greenland Halibut., Despite the commercial importance of Greenland Halibut, major knowledge gaps still persist for this species, namely pertaining to its reproduction cycle and sex determination mechanisms. In this study, we used a compendium of recent technologies [single-molecule sequencing of long reads (Pacific Sciences) with chromatin conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) data and whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of individuals] to provide the very first chromosome-level genome reference and explore the sex determination mechanism of this demersal fish. The chromosome-level assembly and the investigation of its syntenic relationships with other economically important flatfish species highlight the high conservation of synteny blocks within the flatfish phylogenetic clade. In fish, the early evolutionary stage of most sex chromosomes and the subsequent small differences between those chromosomes make it extremely difficult to find diagnostic differences between them. Our sex determination analysis revealed that flatfishes do not escape this rule and exhibit a high level of lability and turnover in SD mechanisms. A whole-genome sequencing approach of 198 individuals allowed us to unravel the molecular SD system in Greenland Halibut. Specifically, our results support the view that Greenland Halibut has a male heterogametic XY system, with several putative candidate genes, also described as SD drivers in other flatfish species like the Turbot (S. maximus) and the Japanese Flounder. Interestingly, our study also suggested for the first time in flatfish the presence of a putative Y-autosomal fusion that could be associated with a reduction of recombination typical of the early stages of sex chromosome evolution., Genome assembly is available on GenBank with accession number GCA_006182925.3.

Its natural range is found primarily along the northern California Pacific Ocean coastline (Lorimer et al. 2009), although coast redwood trees have been planted all over the world. Coast redwood is the tallest of all trees (the tallest discovered to date is 115.5 m) and among the oldest (living up to ∼2200 years) (Lanner 1999). As currently taxonomically circumscribed, coast redwood is the only extant member of its genus Sequoia and is considered “endangered” by the IUCN Red List (Farjon and Schmid 2013). Each of its two closest relatives, giant sequoia (Sequioadendron giganteum) and dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), is also the only extant member of its genus. Coast redwood has a hexaploid genome (Hirayoshi and Nakamura 1943; Stebbins 1948; Saylor and Simons 1970; Ahuja and Neale 2002) (2n = 6x = 66), whereas giant sequoia and dawn redwood are diploids (2n = 2x = 22). Coast redwood has a very large genome (originally estimated at 31.5 Gbp), approximately three times that of each of its two diploid relatives (9.7 Gbp for giant sequoia and 10.8 Gbp for dawn redwood) [genome size estimates compiled in Ahuja and Neale (2005), converted from previously published flow cytometry measurements in pg/C where 1 pg = 980 Mbp]. The origin of polyploidy in coast redwood has been debated for many years. Stebbins (1948) proposed that it might be an autoallopolyploid, later supported by Ahuja and Neale (2002). However, in a more recent study, Scott et al. (2016) argued that an autopolyploid origin was more likely., Coast redwood forests were extensively logged (nearly 95% of virgin forest) following immigration of Europeans into California (Burns et al. 2018). There is currently strong interest in accelerating the return of old-growth forest characteristics including a diverse forest structure with large-stature trees. Restoration and conservation efforts rely critically on the ability to measure and monitor genetic variation. Traditionally, foresters have estimated genetic variation by measuring phenotypes in some type of field test, such as a provenance test (Kuser et al. 1995). This approach yields high quality data about the amounts and distribution of genetic variation across a landscape; however, this approach takes many years and tests are expensive to establish, maintain, and measure. An alternative approach is to use genetic markers. However, nearly all genetic markers developed to date in coast redwood (Ahuja 2017) reveal genetic variation in noncoding regions of the genome, thus they estimate only selectively neutral variation. The ability to interrogate genomic regions under selection and estimate adaptive genetic diversity requires genetic markers from protein-coding regions of the genome. Such markers have not existed for coast redwood and can only be developed following transcriptome or whole-genome sequencing., Genome sequencing in conifers did not begin until 10 years after the sequencing of the human genome because of economic and technical limitations. Conifer genomes are 3–10 times larger than the human genome, and the highly repetitive content of these genomes made genome assembly challenging. Beginning in the decade 2010–2020, these limitations were gradually overcome and currently nine conifer genome sequences have been reported; Norway spruce (Picea abies) (Nystedt et al. 2013), Sitka × Engelman spruce hybrid (Picea sitchensis × Picea engelmannii) (Birol et al. 2013), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (Neale et al. 2014; Zimin et al. 2014), white spruce (Picea glauca) (Warren et al. 2015), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) (Stevens et al. 2016), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Neale et al. 2017), silver fir (Abies alba) (Mosca et al. 2019), Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) (Kuzmin et al. 2019), and giant sequoia (Scott et al. 2020). A key feature of many conifer species is the presence of haploid megagametophytic tissue within the otherwise diploid tissue of the seeds. In many cases, this haploid tissue can be dissected from a single seed in a large-enough quantity for complete genome sequencing, thereby simplifying the assembly. All of the genome sequences reported above used megagametophyte tissue, except for white spruce. All these genome assemblies currently are highly fragmented assemblies, with the notable exception of that for giant sequoia which employed long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding to obtain 11 chromosome-scale scaffolds equaling the known chromosome number (Scott et al. 2020). A nearly identical sequencing strategy is used here to sequence and assemble the coast redwood genome., As a result, we report the following: the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the very large and hexaploid coast redwood genome; the discovery of genes for estimating evolutionary adaptive potential of coast redwood in current and future environments; and investigation of the origin of coast redwood hexaploidy., The reference tree, SESE104, was found in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA. The tree is 107.2 m tall and is estimated to be 1390 years old. Cones were collected for seed from which to isolate megagametophytes (1n) for DNA isolation and Illumina sequencing. Needles (2n) were collected for high molecular weight DNA isolation for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing and HiRise scaffolding., Following the protocol used recently for the giant sequoia genome (Scott et al. 2020), we generated two types of reads: short, highly accurate Illumina reads and long, somewhat less accurate ONT reads. The Illumina data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument in high-yield mode at the UC Davis Genome Center. We used standard PCR-free library preparation after extracting megagametophyte DNA from a single seed from the SESE104 tree, following the strategy used for loblolly pine (Neale et al. 2014) and other conifers., Because ONT sequencers require much more DNA than can be obtained from a single seed, we used needle tissue for DNA extraction and sample preparation to produce >20x coverage from ONT long- reads. In 2017, we collected foliage from the upper canopy of the same coast redwood tree (SESE104) from which the seed originated. From this foliage, we extracted high molecular weight DNA following the protocol described in Workman et al. (2018). We first isolated purified genomic DNA through a nuclei extraction and lysis protocol. The mature needle tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen, then added to a gentle lysis buffer (after Zhang et al. 2012), containing spermine, spermidine, triton, and β-mercaptoethanol) and stirred at 4°C for 10 min. Cellular homogenate was filtered through five layers of Miracloth into a 50 ml Falcon tube, then centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 1900 × g, which was selected based on an estimated genome size of around 28 Gbp. Extracted nuclei were then lysed and gDNA precipitated using the Circulomics Nanobind Plant Nuclei Big DNA kit, alpha version (SKU NB-900-801-01). Then 1 μg of purified genomic DNA was input into the Ligation sequencing kit (LSK108-LSK109, Oxford Nanopore Technologies), according to protocol, with the exception of end repair optimization (100 μl sample, 14 μl enzyme, 6 μl enzyme at 20°C for 20 min, then 65°C for 20 min). Samples were sequenced on R9.4 minION flowcells using either the minION or GridION for 48 h, then raw fast5 data was basecalled with Albacore version 2.13., Additional leaf tissue from SESE104 was sent to Dovetail Genomics (Scotts Valley, CA, USA) for preparation of proximity ligation libraries using both the Chicago and Hi-C protocols, as described by Putnam et al. (2016). Each of these libraries captured long-range interactions within chromosomes, which in turn allows for substantial improvement in the scaffold size of resulting assemblies. Sequencing of both libraries, yielding ∼39X genome coverage for each (Table 1), was done at the UC Davis Genome Center on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.,  Sequence data generated for the coast redwood genome, Coverage is computed using the estimated genome size of 26.5 Gbp as described in the following text.,  Sequence data generated for the coast redwood genome, Coverage is computed using the estimated genome size of 26.5 Gbp as described in the following text., The overall assembly followed a protocol very similar to that used for the giant sequoia genome (Scott et al. 2020). To create the initial contig assembly, we used MaSuRCA version 3.2.8 in its hybrid mode, which combines long and short reads (Zimin et al. 2017). MaSuRCA is based on the idea of producing super-reads by extending Illumina reads uniquely using k-mer graphs (Zimin et al. 2013). All Illumina reads that extend to the same super-read are replaced by a single copy of the super-read. The super-reads are then used to correct the ONT reads. We compute the approximate alignments of the super-reads to ONT reads and then produce mini-assemblies of exactly overlapping super reads for each ONT read that are the best representation of that read’s sequence. We call these mini-assemblies mega-reads., For assembly we used default settings with a single-pass mega-reads construction procedure (using MEGA_READS_ONE_PASS = 1 in the MaSuRCA configuration file). To manage the enormous amount of data, we interrupted the MaSuRCA pipeline at the “create_mega_reads” step. Then we split super-reads into batches and proceeded by matching each batch against the entire set of the ONT reads. First, we produced all approximate alignments of the super-reads to the ONT reads using the “jf_aligner” program in MaSuRCA. The memory usage of jf_aligner is proportional to the amount of sequence in the super-reads, and batching allowed us to use multiple compute nodes in parallel, with 1 TB of RAM each. After all alignments were done, we merged the alignment files with the “merge_coords” program and piped its output into the “longest_path” program, which constructed the mega-reads. Normally all three of these modules are run within a single executable “create_mega_reads”, but they can be separated for unusually large assembly projects. For this task, we used a special-purpose local grid with 50 1TB RAM computers and SLURM scheduler. The memory usage per node was about 0.5 TB and the total compute time for the mega-reads steps was about 800,000 CPU hours. The need to run in batches added significant intermediate storage and overhead expense and thus it is not used by default in MaSuRCA. We saved the output of the longest_path program into a file and resumed the execution of MaSuRCA by re-running the auto-generated assemble.sh script. We note that in the current release of MaSuRCA, version 4.0.3, the mega-reads code has been optimized for memory use and running the components separately is no longer necessary even for genomes similar in size to that of the coast redwood. After postprocessing, MaSuRCA proceeded with no further manual intervention, assembling the mega-reads with a modified version of the CABOG 8 assembler included in MaSuRCA. This assembly step took about 321,160 CPU hours. This step produced assembly version 1.0 (Table 2).,  Results for processing of Illumina reads into super-reads and mega-reads, MaSuRCA reduced the data from over 21 billion Illumina reads into ∼213 million super-reads, preserving the information contained in the Illumina data. The super-reads were then used to transform ONT reads into highly accurate mega-reads.,  Results for processing of Illumina reads into super-reads and mega-reads, MaSuRCA reduced the data from over 21 billion Illumina reads into ∼213 million super-reads, preserving the information contained in the Illumina data. The super-reads were then used to transform ONT reads into highly accurate mega-reads., We delivered the 1.0 assembly to Dovetail Genomics for scaffolding with proximity ligation data. They utilized the HiRise scaffolder (Putnam et al. 2016) to scaffold the contigs, using linked reads from both “Chicago” and Hi-C libraries. This process first mapped all the reads from each library to the contigs, and then linked together contigs based on the number of paired reads connecting them. Contigs with larger numbers of linking reads should be closer together in the final scaffolds, and the scaffolder attempts to optimize inter-contig distances as a function of the number of linking reads. After multiple rounds of scaffolding, this process yielded assembly version 2.1., We examined the scaffolds produced by the HiRise scaffolder to look for telomere and centromere sequences. We identified the sequence of the telomere to be CCCT[A/C]AA by running the Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF) software on the contigs and looking for the most common repeats. We also found the following very high-copy number 148-bp repeat sequence, which we determined to be the centromeric repeat unit: AAAAAATGAAGGTTCGCGAAAGGCGATAGAAAATACGCGTACAGAATGCACAACTACAGTGCAATCCACAATCGTAGTCACCAAAGTTGATCGATGGCCCACGAAAACTCAAACACGAGCGGTTTCCTAAATGCGGCTATAACTCAAC., We used the Nucmer software from the MUMmer 4 package (Marçais et al. 2018) to look for these telomere and centromere sequences in the scaffolds. For the purpose of counting distinct centromeric regions, we merged all copies of centromeres that were separated by less than 250 Kbp. Overall, this process identified 33 centromeric regions, corresponding to the expected number of 33 chromosomes. During this process, we split scaffolds in 15 locations, based on telomere position and orientation and on not allowing any scaffold to contain more than one centromeric region. For example, the longest scaffold in the initial Dovetail scaffold set was ∼1.4 Gbp in length and contained two copies of the centromere, at positions 760 Mbp and 1.02 Gbp (approximately). It contained telomeric sequences at 779 and 980 Mbp, and we therefore split the scaffold at both of the telomere positions, which were presumably chromosome ends. The results of this splitting process, combined with screening for contaminants, which identified nine single-contig scaffolds totaling 46,650 bp that contained human sequences, yielded an updated assembly, which we called version 2.2., RepeatModeler v1.0.8 (Smit and Hubley 2008–2015) identified repeat families using RECON, RepeatScout, and TRF. The classified consensus library was further annotated with LTRclassifier (Monat et al. 2016). The resulting library was provided to RepeatMasker v.4.0.9 (Smit et al. 2019), to generate coordinates for the identified elements and to softmask the genome., Total RNA was extracted from the following nine tissues collected from three individual coast redwoods: foliage from canopy sprouts, foliage from basal sprouts, sylleptic shoot tips, roots, 3-month-old seedling stems, megagametophytes, immature male cones, immature female cones, and mature male cones. Each tissue was immediately treated with liquid nitrogen upon collection, then stored in a −80°C freezer until extraction. All tissues were hand ground under liquid nitrogen with the addition of insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. The tissue was then lysed with the PureLink® Plant RNA Reagent, clarified by centrifugation, isolated using two rounds of NaCl and chloroform wash, precipitated with isopropanol, washed with ethanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. All samples were purified using the Qiagen RNeasy® MinElute® Cleanup Kit and the RNase-free DNase Set., The total RNA was first quantified with a Nanodrop 8000 (avg. concentration = 1596 ng/μl, avg. A260/280 = 2.13; and avg. A260/230 = 2.06). Next, the concentration of pure RNA was determined using a Qubit 2.0 and the Qubit RNA BR assay kit (avg. concentration = 1318 ng/μl). Last, the RNA integrity was determined using the BIO RAD Experion™ automated electrophoresis station using the Experion™ RNA StdSens Analysis Kit (avg. RNA Quality Number = 8.4). The RNA samples were sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Isoform Sequencing (Iso-seq) platform carried out at the UC Davis Genome Center., The Iso-seq data were processed as described by PacBio here: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq/blob/master/isoseq-clustering.md. Briefly, the subreads were merged to generate one full-length circular consensus sequence (CCS). Primer artifacts were removed and the reads demultiplexed by library barcode. Polyadenylated tails and concatemers were trimmed and removed. Finally, the CCS reads were clustered into partial and full-length transcripts. Additional precautions were taken with IsoSeq Polish to generate consensus for each read cluster by generating per base quality values (QVs) for transcript consensus sequences., Currently, there are two RNA-seq libraries available, SRX7171900 (150 bp PE) (Breidenbach et al. 2020), which represents a pooled needle tissue library from multiple clones, and ERX2099880 (100 bp PE) (Matasci et al. 2014), which represents branch apex, including needle, tissue generated for the 1000 Plants (1KP) project. The Illumina sequencing reads were trimmed using Sickle v.1.33 (Joshi and Fass 2011) with the following parameters, quality threshold = 30, length threshold = 50. Trimmed reads were aligned to the coast redwood genome using HiSAT v.2.1.0 (Kim et al. 2019) with maximum intron length set to 2 Mbp. Each aligned library was sorted by read name and subsequently merged using Samtools v.1.9 (Li et al. 2009). The merged aligned reads were used as one of the primary inputs for training the genome annotation pipeline, Braker2 v.2.0.5 (Hoff et al. 2016)., Three independent transcriptomes were concatenated and clustered at 98% identity with vsearch V.2.15.0 (Rognes et al. 2016). These included the Iso-seq transcriptome generated by us for our annotation, the short-read Illumina-derived transcriptome (Scott et al. 2016) available at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7nb70, and the cold-stressed transcriptome (TSA: GIBU01000000) (Breidenbach et al. 2020). The combined resource was frame-selected based on ORF prediction from TransDecoder v.5.0.2. Transcripts with start codon, stop codon, or both (partials or complete) were selected and aligned to the genome with Gmap v. 2019 (Wu and Watanabe 2005) with the following parameters: minimum trimmed coverage and minimum identity = 0.95 (–min-trimmed-coverage, –min-identity), full length proteins (−F), intron length = 1,000,000 (−K), maximum total intron length = 10,000,000 (−L), cds start = 1 (−a), more sensitive search for canonical splicing (–cross-species), truncate alignment around full-length protein (−T), and return the single best alignment hit (−n = 1). These CDS alignments were subject to constraints and quantification with gFACs (Caballero and Wegrzyn 2019). These constraints include: minimum exon and intron length = 9 bps, minimum cds length = 100 bps. The translated sequences of the transcriptomes generated previously were aligned to the coast redwood transcriptome using genome Threader v.1.6.6 (Gremme et al. 2005) with the following parameters: start codon, final stop codon, intron cut-out, dpminexonlen = 20, dpminintronlen = 9, gcmaxgapwidth = 1,000,000, and gcmincoverage = 80. These high-quality transcriptome and protein alignments served as an additional source of evidence when annotating the coast redwood genome., The primary inputs provided to Braker included the soft-masked genome, RNA-seq alignments, and protein alignments. The merged RNA-seq alignment trains GeneMark-ET by using read pile up to estimate intron/exon boundaries of putative genes. The protein alignments are an optional component for structural annotations in Braker2. Although they do not directly impact the estimation of intron/exon boundaries during GeneMark-ET training, they contribute to the training of AUGUSTUS., Given the large search space, high repeat content, and increased frequency of pseudogenes, it is a reasonable assumption that many of the predicted genes are false positives, fragmented, pseudogenes, or retroelements. Additional constraints are required to reduce the ab initio gene set. The ab initio genes must pass the following criteria through gFACs: complete open reading frame, a minimum exon and intron length of 9 bps, and minimum CDS length of 100 bps. Finally, the transcriptome sourced alignments are compared with the structurally filtered Braker models. Overlapping models are resolved through Bedtools v2.29 (Quinlan and Hall 2010)., In addition to structure, we leveraged functional information to determine a gene’s validity. We used EnTAP v0.10.4 (Hart et al. 2020) to identify genes that align to proteins from Uniprot (Apweiler et al. 2004), Plant RefSeq (Wheeler et al. 2005), and/or the proteomes of other gymnosperms. The custom gymnosperm database included proteins from: P. abies, P. sitchensis, Ginkgo biloba, Cycas micholitzii, Gnetum montanum, Taxus baccata, and Abies sachalinensis. Genes without sequence similarity search results, a single protein domain alignment, or a gene family assignment, are discarded. Removal of retroelements from the gene space was accomplished with InterPro Scan v.5.35-74.0 (Jones et al. 2014) using Pfam. This filter is coupled with the requirement that genes flagged as retroelements are at least 70% softmasked. Given that the mono-exonic gene space is highly inflated due to the presence of pseudogenes, the mono-exonic proteins are aligned to the multiexonic proteins requiring at least 75% identity and covering at least 70% of the mono-exonic gene., Proteomes for all available gymnosperms were downloaded from the forest genomics database TreeGenes (Falk et al. 2018). The Amborella trichopoda proteome (Chamala et al. 2013) was used as an outgroup to the gymnosperm taxa (accessed via Ensembl, Howe et al. 2020). Redundancy within a transcriptome was reduced by clustering the sequence at 80% identity with USEARCH (Edgar 2010). Species containing at least 15 K unique sequences were evaluated for completeness with BUSCO v4.0.2 (Seppey et al. 2019) in protein mode using the Embryophyta lineage of OrthoDBv10 (Waterhouse et al. 2013). Species with at least 60% completeness were included in OrthoFinder (Emms and Kelly 2019) to identify orthogroups. Coast redwood genes in any gene family were clustered at 70% identity with USEARCH to determine their duplication status. Finally, coast redwood genes were aligned to the Arabidopsis proteome with Diamond v.0.9.36 (Hu and Kurgen 2019). As a result, this created a mapping between coast redwood genes and Arabidopsis genes which allowed for enrichment analysis through functional profiling available in Gprofiler (Raudvere et al. 2019). Families were examined for unique presence/absence as well as expansion/contraction determined from those with at least a 2-fold deviation for that family. Based on the unexpected ratio of Copia elements identified, genes with Copia insertions (within 3 Kbp) were identified. A subset of these genes was enriched for flavonoid metabolic process and flavonoid biosynthesis and used as input for GeneMania (Montojo et al. 2014). Additional refinement of the network was done in Cytoscape (Su et al. 2014)., Ninety-two coast redwood samples from a greenhouse population that included accessions from the Kuser trial (Kuser et al. 1995), which cover the geographic and environmental natural range of the species were sequenced with 64,358 SNPs. Details on sequence capture, sequencing, SNP calling and filtering can be found in De La Torre et al. (2021). Fixation index (Fst) among populations was estimated using the method from Weir and Cockerham (1984) using the –weir-fst-pop option in VCFtools (Danecek et al. 2011). Data were analyzed using sliding windows with a step of 1000 (–fst-window-step option) and a window size of 10000 (–fst-window-size option) in VCFtools. Nucleotide diversity (PI) was also estimated using the sliding windows method used for Fst analyses (–window-pi and –window-pi-step options) in VCFtools. Nucleotide diversity and Fst estimates for coast redwood were compared with estimates from an unpublished study using similar targeted sequencing methods and number of SNPs in giant sequoia., Nucleotide sequence divergence was estimated for the single-copy genes identified in the syntenic regions between coast redwood and giant sequoia and for the genes that were identified as unique to the coast redwood lineage (coast redwood, giant sequoia, and dawn redwood). The genes unique to the redwood lineage were found in multiple copies in coast redwood but in single copy in giant sequoia. Nucleotide sequences for 11 single-copy genes identified in the syntenic regions and 19 genes unique to the redwood lineage were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 2014). For each alignment, Kimura 2-parameters distance was estimated using MEGA vX (Kumar et al. 2018) and pairwise synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates were calculated using PAML v.4.8 (Yang 2007). The parameters for the CODEML control file included runmode = −2 for pairwise comparisons, cleandata = 0 for treating alignment gap as ambiguous characters, F3 × 4 model for determining codon frequencies along with default settings of initial values of 2 and 0.4 for estimating transition/transversion rate ratio and omega, respectively., Phylogeny was inferred for the multicopy genes across the gene space to understand their relationships with other gymnosperms. The dataset included the genes that were present in multicopy (2 or 3 copies) in coast redwood but present as a single copy in other gymnosperms. With this criterion, 1700 genes were initially identified, which were further filtered based on their length (>300 amino acids) and shared at least 75% of the maximum sequence length. In addition, we removed gene variants resulting from possible tandem duplication from the analyses and that reduced the number of genes to 298. From these genes, we randomly sampled 150 and aligned their amino acid sequences using MUSCLE 3.8 (Edgar 2004) to infer phylogenetic relationships. For each alignment, maximum likelihood analysis was performed using IQTREE2 v.2.1.2 (Minh et al. 2020) with the substitution model selected based on Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) using ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017); branch support was assessed using nonparametric bootstrap from 300 pseudoreplicates., We used a hybrid sequencing and assembly strategy, combining accurate but relatively short Illumina paired-end reads with long, less-accurate reads from ONT sequencers. We used Dovetail’s Chicago and Hi-C library preparations to generate proximity ligation libraries that we used for scaffolding the assembled contigs. Illumina paired-end reads and ONT reads were used for building contigs, and reads from the Chicago and Hi-C libraries were only used for scaffolding. Sequencing data are summarized by library in Table 1., We estimated the haploid genome size by first counting 31-mers in the Illumina reads using the Jellyfish program (Marçais and Kingsford 2011). The main distribution peak in the 31-mer histogram (Figure 1) shows that the peak 31-mer coverage was 57. The number of 31-mers under the main peak is 1,503,160,425,741, which yields a genome size estimate of 1,503,160,425,741/57 = ∼26.5 Gbp. While this estimate is lower than the one based on flow cytometry, it should be close to the size of euchromatin (i.e., noncentromeric DNA), as has been shown previously when using k-mers to estimate genome size (Vurture et al. 2017)., The distribution of 31-mers in coast redwood Illumina short-read data collected from a haploid sample. The primary peak is at X = 57. The number of 31-mers is estimated using the area under the curve, excluding the low-count k-mers that likely are due to errors in base-calling. The three peaks (X = 57: ∼118 and ∼180) reflect the hexaploid nature of the genome; these contain 31-mers that are identical in two or three of the subgenomes., The distribution of 31-mers in coast redwood Illumina short-read data collected from a haploid sample. The primary peak is at X = 57. The number of 31-mers is estimated using the area under the curve, excluding the low-count k-mers that likely are due to errors in base-calling. The three peaks (X = 57: ∼118 and ∼180) reflect the hexaploid nature of the genome; these contain 31-mers that are identical in two or three of the subgenomes., The MaSuRCA assembler (Zimin et al. 2013) first extended all Illumina reads with unique extensions based on k-mers (k = 127) present in the Illumina data, creating longer “super-reads.” The super-reads averaged 352 bp (Table 2) and there were ∼213 million of them, compared to over 10 billion Illumina reads. Total CPU time for super-read construction was 11,472 h, with maximum memory usage of 1.2 TB. MaSuRCA then used the ONT reads as templates, aligning super-reads to them and producing paths of exactly overlapping super-reads that matched the underlying ONT read. These paths were then used to create mega-reads (Zimin et al. 2017), which are highly accurate replacements for the ONT reads. The mega-reads were slightly shorter than the ONT reads, because some ONT reads yielded two or more nonoverlapping mega-reads, as described previously. Note that because the ONT reads were produced from diploid DNA, about 50% of them came from a haplotype that was different from the haplotype represented by the Illumina reads. In some of these cases, insertion/deletion differences between the haplotypes may have resulted in alignment breaks and thus breaks in the mega-reads., The results from the initial assembly, the assembly after scaffolding with HiRise, and the final assembly (v2.2) of the coast redwood genome are shown in Table 3. The v1.0 assembly consisted predominantly of contigs with only minimal scaffolding, thus the N50 contig and scaffold numbers are very similar, 96,840 bp for contigs and 109,446 bp for scaffolds. The final assembly (v2.2) went through two rounds of HiRise scaffolding with Chicago and Hi-C data, followed by additional postprocessing. Scaffolding with Hi-C (proximity ligation) data increased the N50 scaffold size to 53 Mbp. After examining the assembly for repeats, we noticed that several of the longest scaffolds in the v2.1 assembly contained centromeric and telomeric repeats in the middle of the scaffold (see Materials and Methods). We used these repeats to introduce 15 breaks in the scaffolds to obtain the final assembly (v2.2). This reduced the N50 scaffold size slightly, to ∼45 Mbp. We also removed nine small contigs that we identifi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d as contaminants. The v2.2 assembly has 33 scaffolds that contain centromeric regions, corresponding to the expected number of chromosomes. Names and sizes for these 33 scaffolds can be found in Supplementary Table S1. Four of the 33 also have telomeric repeats on one end, suggesting that they represent nearly complete chromosome arms. The 21 largest scaffolds in this set contain about 7 Gbp of sequence.,  Assembly statistics for coast redwood, for the initial v1.0 assembly, the scaffolded v2.1 assembly, and the final v2.2 assembly, For consistency, we computed the N50 sizes for contigs and scaffolds using 26.5 Gbp as the estimated genome size,  Assembly statistics for coast redwood, for the initial v1.0 assembly, the scaffolded v2.1 assembly, and the final v2.2 assembly, For consistency, we computed the N50 sizes for contigs and scaffolds using 26.5 Gbp as the estimated genome size, During assembly of the Illumina data, we discovered reads representing two apparently novel fungal species, which were present in sufficient quantity to produce high-quality assemblies of each genome. The methods and results of assembling and identifying these species are described in Supplementary File S1., The overall alignment rate of the RNA-seq needle libraries, SRX7171900 and ERX2099880, was 80% and 87.96%, respectively. The concatenated transcripts and fragments contained 409,920,622,955, and 128,005 transcripts from the PacBio Iso-Seq long-read transcripts, de novo short read assembled needle transcripts from Breidenbach et al. (2020) and de novo short read assembled transcripts from Scott et al. (2016), respectively. After clustering, these transcripts collapsed into 131,842 PacBio Iso-Seq high quality transcripts,568,778 transcripts from Breidenbach et al. (2020), and 97:764 from Scott et al. (2016). The combined reference transcriptome with 798,384 transcripts achieves 94.4% completeness when assessed with the BUSCO V5.0 Embryophyta lineage odb 10. After frame selection,256,322 transcripts remained (90.8% BUSCO completeness) of which 202,414 were either full-length (132,195) or partial transcripts (70,219) (overall N50: 49,080 bps, BUSCO completeness 90.6%). From the 202,414 transcripts 137:146 transcripts aligned to the genome at 95% identity and coverage. After constraining the alignment to be at least 100 bps, setting minimum intron and exon sizes of 9 bps, removing duplicates, and removing all incomplete protein-coding transcripts,114,113 transcripts remained with 68.9% BUSCO completeness (Table 4).,  Transcriptome statistics: Illumina short-read and PacBio Iso-Seq needle tissue assemblies,  Transcriptome statistics: Illumina short-read and PacBio Iso-Seq needle tissue assemblies, Soft masking of the genome resulted in approximately 18.7 Gbp classified as repetitive (872 unique elements covering 70% of the genome). As is typical of conifers, this portion is dominated by transposable elements (TEs), which represent 59% (11.1 Gb) of the repetitive elements, of which ∼80% (8.7 Gb) are long terminal repeats (LTRs). Specifically, Gypsy and Copia elements are LTR-RT superfamilies that are prevalent across land plant phylogeny and constitute a significant portion of repetitive content (Casacuberta and Santiago 2003). Gypsy and Copia elements are differentially positioned in plant genomes (Ou and Jiang 2018). Copia elements are distributed proximal to genes, whereas Gypsy elements tend to be found in heterochromatic or pericentromeric regions (Baucom et al. 2009). In the coast redwood genome, these superfamilies span 8 Gbp (2.06 and 5.94 Gbp for Copia and Gypsy, respectively) and have a 2.88:1 ratio in favor of Copia. In coast redwood,10,512 genes are associated with Copia-element insertions. These genes are primarily associated (enriched) for the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways (Supplementary Figure S1). Among the gene ontology (GO) processes enriched, we note that response to biotic stress, bacterium, temperature, and heat were also dominant., The number of putative gene models retained for the final annotation was 118,906, of which 86,784 are multiexonic and 32,122 are mono-exonic. From these 118,906 gene models,108,231 were constructed from aligned evidence, and 10,675 are derived exclusively from the transcriptome alignment. These transcripts extended 173,075 gene models from the initial 3.6 million gene models. Without the transcriptomic gene models, the BUSCO v.5.0 completeness score for the Embryophyta lineage was only 33% vs 67.8% with the addition of transcriptome alignment. Furthermore, characterization of the gene space using transcriptome alignment increased the overall average gene length by 93% (Table 5).,  Structural genome annotation summary,  Structural genome annotation summary, Applying a stringent reciprocal functional annotation approach, we found 55,402 sequences had an alignment to the custom conifer database, NCBI’s Plant RefSeq, or UniProt database. The vast majority could be aligned to the precomputed EggNOG gene family database (117:714). The sequence alignments were primarily sourced from the conifer library with Abies sachalinensis representing the majority of the alignments followed by Arabidopsis and Amborella from the other databases. The GO terms applied from the gene family assignments and 96,006 (81%) could be assigned at least one term. The number of genes appearing to be novel is 591, when compared to existing public databases (Supplementary Table S1)., To investigate functional patterns among genes with the largest introns, three length groups were analyzed. Coast redwood genes with introns ranging from 50 to 100 Kbp were assessed for functional enrichment (1918 genes in total) (Supplementary Table S1). This set was enriched from a KEGG pathway perspective in both nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its derivative NADP are well-conserved metabolites that orchestrate plant cellular redox homeostasis. These nucleotides also play vital roles in signaling via reactive oxygen species and in systems that respond to abiotic stressors, including: UV irradiation, salinity, heat shock, and drought (Manai et al. 2013). The independent GO enrichment identified the following processes: lipid metabolic processes, ncRNA processing, oxoacid metabolic processes, nitrogen, and organonitrogen compound metabolic processing, heterocyclic metabolic process, post translational gene silencing, and macromolecular methylation. In addition, terpenoid, amylopectin, and sulfur-compound biosynthesis were also enriched to a lesser degree. Among the 432 genes that contain introns ranging from 101 to 500 Kbp, pathways supporting glucose sensing and signaling as well as flower development were enriched. The latter may relate more to seed development of other aspects of phenology of coast redwood. In terms of enriched GO biological processes, RNA processing was the predominant process observed outside of general metabolic processes. The number of genes with introns that exceed 500 Kbp in length was 113. Among these, only one primary pathway and process were enriched and this relates to valyl-tRNA aminoacylation. Over-expression of genes from this pathway have been associated with increased resilience to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis (Richardson and Mullen 2011)., The gene family analysis, conducted with OrthoFinder, included 22 species and represented 841,087 proteins, of which 81% (680,419) could form putative gene families (orthogroups containing two or more proteins). The 35,647 resulting orthogroups represented 1155 species-specific orthogroups and 5665 with membership from all 22 species. Coast redwood genes could be found in about 44% of the total putative gene families. Only 54 orthogroups were identified as single-copy across the broad phylogenetic range assessed. Nearly 77% of the genes for coast redwood formed gene families, while 88% and 95% formed orthogroups for giant sequoia (from the genome annotation) and metasequoia (from a transcriptome), respectively (Supplementary Figure S2). There were 790 gene families identified as having three copies in coast redwood compared to a single copy in giant sequoia and metasequoia. Another 1075 families contained two copies in coast redwood compared to single copies in the same two species. Accounting for likely tandem gene duplications in coast redwood, there are 1394 gene families (288 of which contain tandem duplicates in coast redwood) that are single-copy across giant sequoia, metasequoia, and coast redwood. In addition, coast redwood had the largest number of species-specific gene families at 460. The resulting gene families were queried for patterns that may describe presence/absence and possible expansion/contraction in coast redwood, or among the Cupressaceae. Our summary of these results follows here and we provide a more detailed analysis in Supplementary File S2., We found 460 gene families present in coast redwood and absent in all other compared species. Gene families associated with abiotic and biotic stress were shown to form the majority of the unique families in coast redwood. A bifunctional abietadiene synthase (OG0022263) species-specific family was identified and is associated with defensive oleoresin formation in conifers in response to pest attack or physical injury (Celedon and Bohlmann 2019). These genes are specifically involved in diterpene olefins biosynthesis. In addition, a terpene synthase (OG0026422), involved in sesquiterpene, diterpene, and monoterpene biosynthesis, was present. An Ent-kaurene oxidase-like gene family (OG0035511), was identified and is involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. These diterpenoid hormones are precursors for most terpenoid products involved in defense. A flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase-like gene family (OG0026401) was noted. Flavonoid biosynthesis is an important branch of phenylalanine metabolism, and these compounds are regulated by the transcription profiles of several genes and manipulated by MYB transcription factors that are known to be expanded in conifers (Li 2014). Flavonoid components, such as flavone, flavonol, flavanols, procyanidins, and anthocyanins are modified in the presence of abiotic stress (in response to cell damage) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4622623/). Among the broad category of genes known as lipases, a lipase class 3-like protein family (OG0035575) was identified. These were recently associated with activating salicylic acid-dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis (Lai et al. 2017)., We identified 1706 gene families present in coast redwood but not in other species of Cupressaceae. Related to plant stress and the proliferation of TEs common in conifers, Chromo (OG0011748; CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) as well as components of the FACT complex (OG0013343) and YT521 (OG0031005) were identified. These genes are associated with regulating chromatin structure and with epigenetic repression. A likely member of the WAX2 gene family (OG0013236), associated with the synthesis of the cuticle, was identified. Variations on WAX2 in plants, as studied in Arabidopsis, leads to variable structures and drought tolerance (less water loss) (Chen et al. 2003). Several xyloglucan endotransglycosylation families were identified (OG0015084; OG0020157; OG0025511; OG0026451; OG0034404; OG0035623; OG0012689). These genes cleave and regulate xyloglucan polymers, an essential constituent of the primary cell wall, and participate in cell-wall construction in growing tissues. In the case of mechanical stress, it may contribute to adaptive changes in morphogenesis by being recruited to alter the tissue’s tensil strength, or flexibility, enabling adaptation to mechanically stressful environments (Peña et al. 2004). Heparanase-like genes (OG0032932) are associated with abiotic stress in several plant species and also with structural remodeling (Ni et al. 2020). In terms of nutrient acquisition, a formamidase-like gene family was identified (OG0033463). It has been shown to induce proteoid roots in nutrient deprived soils (phosphorus and nitrogen) (Rath et al. 2010). In addition, a bark storage protein family (OG0032932), associated with nitrogen storage and differentially induced by nitrogen in Populus (Coleman et al. 1993), was noted., We found that 7724 gene families expanded specifically in coast redwood. Metal-ion related genes were prevalent, including MATE transporters (OG0000181; OG0000326; OG0026382) and heavy metal associated proteins (OG0000170; OG0003233; OG0003549; OG0016719; OG0018282). Detoxification proteins and Transparent Testa-12 like proteins were also well represented. Detoxification 27(OG0012979; OG0000322), Detoxification 29 (OG0013597; OG0019025; OG0000383), Detoxification 40 (OG0003366), Detoxification 42 (OG0004540), and Detoxification 56 (OG0011608) were observed in large numbers. The related TESTA genes are regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis (Zhang and Shrader 2017). In addition, UDP-rhamnose-dependent rhamnosyltransferase (OG0000043), involved in anthocyanin modification, was observed (Hsu et al. 2017). The largest gene families in coast redwood were associated with disease resistance, and in specific, disease resistance protein RPM1-like (OG0000038). This protein specifically recognizes the AvrRpm1 type III effector avirulence protein from Pseudomonas syringae (Guttman and Greenberg 2001). Resistance proteins guard the plant against pathogens that contain an appropriate avirulence protein via an indirect interaction with this avirulence protein. Acidic endochitinase (OG0000527) is another very large family uniquely expanded in coast redwood. This protein functions as a defense against chitin containing fungal pathogens. Finally, oxophytodienoate reductase (OG0000500) was identified and is associated with pathogen response., Results of the analyses of the exome capture data in 92 individuals suggest an average nucleotide diversity of 0.0001842 for coast redwood. This estimate is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the average nucleotide diversity per site for most outcrossing widespread gymnosperms (Savolainen and Pyhäjärvi 2007). When we compared coast redwood to its closest relative (giant sequoia), we found similar levels of average nucleotide diversity and average population Fst: 0.0001842 and 0.01127 for coast redwood, respectively, and 0.000089 and 0.01593 for giant sequoia, respectively., We aligned the entire coast redwood genome to the giant sequoia genome at the DNA level (see Materials and Methods), but the divergence is too great to detect genome-scale similarity. However, we were able to detect several large-scale regions of synteny, the largest of which spanned approximately 70 Mbp on giant sequoia chromosome 8 and coast redwood Scaffold_195192 (Supplementary Figure S3). The figure shows extensive rearrangements, but the overall synteny is clear., Genes in this region that are still intact in both coast redwood and giant sequoia provided the basis for our analysis of the divergence between coast redwood and giant sequoia. By focusing on these genes, and independently on additional copies of the coast redwood genes, we hoped to determine whether the coast redwood genome duplications had occurred more or less recently than the divergence between coast redwood and giant sequoia., An additional OrthoFinder analysis focused on the genes located in these syntenic regions: 416 genes from giant sequoia, 1197 genes from coast redwood, and available dawn redwood transcripts. This resulted in 11 single-copy gene families across the three species (Supplementary Table S2). The nucleotide variation across the 11 gene families assessed was 0.017–0.478 (1.7–48%). The low levels of variation among single-copy genes are expected. Those with greater variation could reflect differences in selection pressure or the inclusion of paralogs rather than orthologs in the analysis. Although the single-copy genes in the syntenic blocks are likely to be orthologs, it is conceivable that evolutionary processes such as gene duplication could result in paralogs. Similarly, dS and dN values are comparably low except for the four genes, OG0000185, OG0000195, OG0000251, and OG0000254, for which both dS and dN values have increased substantially. However, all have dN/dS values less than 1 indicating these genes may be under purifying selection., Similarly, dN/dS < 1 was also observed for the majority of the genes unique to the redwood lineage, which includes multicopy sequences for coast redwood. The substitution rates remained consistently low for most genes, except for OG0018829, OG0018857, and OG0018879, for which increase in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates were noted for a variant sequence in the coast redwood. The overall nucleotide variation for these genes ranged from 0.024 to 0.56 with the majority of genes having <10% nucleotide variation between coast redwood and giant sequoia., Phylogenetic analysis of multicopy genes, sourced from the full genome annotation of coast redwood and giant sequoia, resulted in maximum likelihood trees with coast redwood variants forming a clade for 135 genes, which includes 91 genes with two variants and 44 genes with three variants, out of 150 randomly selected genes (Supplementary Table S3). Among these 135 genes, 78 supported giant sequoia as sister to coast redwood, which was substantially higher compared to the 26 genes supporting dawn redwood as sister to coast redwood (Figure 2). The remaining 31 genes did not show clear relationships to either dawn redwood or giant sequoia. The large number of genes supporting giant sequoia as the closest relative to coast redwood was congruent with the previous finding based on the phylogenetic analysis using purely transcriptomic data (Scott et al. 2016). Furthermore, all trees showed the multiple coast redwood gene copies as closer to each other than to other species (Figure 2), which is in agreement with the autopolyploidy hypothesis previously postulated for the origin of coast redwood (Scott et al. 2016)., Frequency of different tree topologies when comparing multicopy genes in coast redwood to orthologous genes in giant sequoia, dawn redwood, and other species., Frequency of different tree topologies when comparing multicopy genes in coast redwood to orthologous genes in giant sequoia, dawn redwood, and other species., The large and repetitive polyploid coast redwood genome provided context for examining gene family dynamics when compared to other well-characterized plant genomes. Here, we noted substantial novelty in regard to both biotic and abiotic stress. Coast redwood is known for its pest and pathogen resistance and gene families associated with secondary metabolism and defense were enriched among the over 400 families that were not shared with the species compared. Among genes present specifically in coast redwood but absent only in other Cupressaceae, numerous genes associated with chromatin remodeling and methyltransferase activity were noted. The prevalence of these gene families, and their expression, is often associated with polyploids (Yuan et al. 2020). While polyploidy is common in species of genus Juniperus, also within the Cupressaceae, no members of this group were represented in this analysis. The enrichment signal may have been diluted with a more comprehensive species representation. Among families significantly expanded in coast redwood, defense-related genes were once again dominant, but we also specifically noted detoxification genes, TESTAs associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, and numerous MATE transporters. These genes have a range of functions, however, drought tolerance, metabolite transport, and development in response to light have been associated (Zhang and Shrader 2017; Volkov and Schwenke 2021)., Intron content and length regulate transcriptional efficiency and can be selected for in an evolutionary context (Heyn et al. 2015; Rose 2019). In addition, the position of the long intron relative to the start site is important (Parra et al. 2011). The maturation of a gene product may be delayed if long introns are present—this is known as intron delay (Heyn et al. 2015). Tissue-specific expression of genes with long introns has been noted in several species (Jeong et al. 2006; Baulin et al. 2020). The final protein-coding gene annotation of coast redwood contains genes with introns nearly 2 Mbp in length which is consistent with observations made in other conifer genomes. The gene containing one of the longest introns is involved in regulation of defense response, regulation of jasmonic acid-mediated signaling pathway, and response to wounding. Among the categories of long introns examined, phenology, drought response, terpenoid production, and regulation of methylation were consistently observed as enriched when compared to the full annotated gene space., As noted in all gymnosperm genomes, repeat content is high and LTRs dominate this landscape. In many plant genomes, Gypsy elements are traditionally associated with genome size evolution (and expansion) (Zhang et al. 2020). However, a recent study in Arabidopsis arenosa, an autotetraploid (with diploid individuals) noted that TE accumulation is higher in genic regions for the tetraploids, and specifically, Copias were enriched in and around genes associated with adaptive traits (and under positive, or relaxed purifying, selection) (Baduel et al. 2019). It has also been reported that Ty1-copia retrotransposons in plants are activated by both abiotic and biotic stressors (Joly-Lopez et al. 2017). These examples include both physical (UV irradiation and wounding) and chemical (salicylic acid) (Kimura et al. 2001). Among the over 10 K genes associated with Copia-element insertions, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were noted as well as genes consistent with the enrichments observed in the gene family analysis., Coast redwood, a mainly asexual species with occasional sexual reproduction showed very low levels of nucleotide diversity, based on exome capture data. This nucleotide diversity was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the average nucleotide diversity per site for most outcrossing widespread gymnosperms (Savolainen and Pyhäjärvi 2007) and similar to the mostly clonal giant duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza, which has some of the lowest values reported for plant species (Xu et al. 2019). Nucleotide diversity was also low for giant sequoia, suggesting the maintenance of all or most groves is required to ensure the long-term survival of the species., Polyploidy is ubiquitous in angiosperms but is quite rare in gymnosperms (Khoshoo 1959; Ahuja 2005; Yang et al. 2012). The hexaploid nature of coast redwood was discovered independently by Japanese and American researchers in the 1940s (Hirayoshi and Nakamura 1943; Stebbins 1948). Stebbins (1948) proposed that the origin of hexaploid coast redwood was alloploidy (hybridization) based on cytogenetic analyses. Later, Ahuja and Neale (2002) modified the Stebbins hypothesis by suggesting that the origin was autoallopolyploidy or segmental polyploidy. The unresolved origin of coast redwood hexaploidy was not addressed again until Scott et al. (2016) proposed that this was just an autopolyploid event based on comparative genome sequencing in coast redwood, giant sequoia, and dawn redwood. We hoped that full genome sequencing in coast redwood and giant sequoia (Scott et al. 2020) might have resolved this issue once and for all. However, the analyses we performed (see Results) were not entirely conclusive but mostly support the autoplolyploid hypothesis of Scott et al. (2020). Ultimately, highly contiguous genome sequences in the three extant redwood species and even the possibility of sequencing extinct redwood species will resolve the origin and timing of the hexaploid nature of coast redwood., The coast redwood v2.2 assembly was deposited at NCBI as GenBank accession VDFB02000000, BioProject PRJNA542879. The genome assembly, annotation, and functional assessment are also available in the TreeGenes database (https://treegenesdb.org/).

More contiguous assemblies provide uses other than gene annotation, for example, identifying the genes associated with quantitative trait loci and understanding of chromosomal rearrangements associated with speciation., Invasions by exotic species that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture (Bradshaw et al. 2016). Biological control by introduction of natural enemies has proved effective at reducing the abundance and impact of such pests (Cock et al. 2016), and in principle provides a safe, cost-effective, sustainable alternative to widespread use of insecticides (Naranjo et al. 2015). Safe and effective biological-control introductions against foreign, invasive pests depend on using narrowly host-specific agents and their establishment in the new environment. Host specificity can be measured experimentally prior to introduction (Hoddle 2005), but the possibility of post-release evolution also needs to be considered. The likelihood that an introduced species will evolve to attack novel hosts depends on the genetic architecture of host use. Not much is known about the evolution or genetics of host specificity in parasitoids, but recent research suggests that the architecture is complex and will require genome-level analyses (Hopper et al.2019, 2021). Furthermore, the establishment of introduced insects depends on their ability to adapt to the climate in a new and changing environment, and such adaptions depend on the genetic architecture of climatic adaptation., As part of a project on the genetic architectures of host use and climatic adaptation, we assembled and annotated the genomes of Aphelinus atriplicis Walker (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), an important natural enemy introduced to control the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov; Hemiptera: Aphididae), a major invasive pest of small grains in North America (Morrison and Peairs 1998), and Aphelinus certus Yasnosh (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), an Asian parasitoid of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae), that appears to have been introduced accidentally at the same time as the soybean aphid and is now a major natural enemy of this pest (Heimpel et al. 2010). We assembled these and other genomes of Aphelinus to find quantitative-trait loci and the underlying genes involved in the evolution of host specificity and climatic adaptation and to study mechanisms of reproductive isolation among the many closely related species in this genus. Ideally, one would make chromosomal-level assemblies of all the species one studied, but this would be prohibitively expensive when one is working with multiple species. One of the rationales for this article was to find out how much gene annotation was improved by a highly contiguous assembly made with multiple types of data and methods compared to a more fragmented assembly. Another rationale was to determine whether we could use a more contiguous assembly of one species to provide improved scaffolding of the assembly of a closely related species., The rationale for the work reported here was to determine the most effective way to allocate sequencing expenditures in a project involving a set of closely related species. Would generating a highly contiguous, chromosomal-level assembly using multiple data types and methods improve the accuracy and completeness of gene annotation in comparison with a fragmented assembly? And, could a highly contiguous assembly be used to improve scaffolding of the assembly of the genome a closely related species for which only short-read data were available?, We present assemblies of A. atriplicis using different data types (Illumina vs PacBio), processing (raw vs error-corrected), and different de novo assemblers. The minimal case would be to create assemblies using only one data type, which would be cheaper than using combined data. (Within the single-data assemblies, Illumina-only is currently about 1/10 the cost of PacBio-only). We made a meta-assembly with selected de novo assemblies and scaffolded this meta-assembly with a genetic map. We evaluate the output from different approaches and describe the pipeline for the procedure that produced the overall best assembly (Figure 1)., Pipeline for assembly of the genome of Aphelinus atriplicis. Orange boxes are inputs and outputs; blue boxes are processing steps. The step numbers reference text in Materials and Methods and Supplementary Material., Pipeline for assembly of the genome of Aphelinus atriplicis. Orange boxes are inputs and outputs; blue boxes are processing steps. The step numbers reference text in Materials and Methods and Supplementary Material., Meta-assembly, also known as assembly reconciliation, is an increasingly popular approach to providing higher quality genome assemblies (Wences and Schatz 2015; Babb et al. 2017; Torresen et al. 2017; Patel et al. 2018; Song et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2020). This approach takes advantage of differences in the sequence information captured by assemblers that differ in how well they deal with coverage level, repetitive or duplicated sequences, and sequencing errors. Because of these differences, one assembler may cover gaps between contigs produced by another assembler, and the combination of multiple assemblies can improve contiguity substantially., We scaffolded the meta-assembly of A. atriplicis using markers from a genetic map of hybrids between A. atriplicis and A. certus. We compared the completeness and contiguity of the best de novo assembly, the meta-assembly made using 11 de novo assemblies, and the genetic linkage-scaffolded (GLS) assembly of this meta-assembly. For A. certus, we used the GLS assembly of A. atriplicis to scaffold an Illumina-only de novo assembly. Finally, we compared the gene annotations of these assemblies. The pipeline for our approach is given in Figure 1, and details of the programs and versions we used are in Supplementary Table S1, and parameters, commands, and scripts are in Supplementary Document S1., The de novo assemblies differed in several metrics of contiguity with no one assembly being best across all metrics. For A. atriplicis, the meta-assembly metrics were superior to de novo assemblies. Scaffolding the meta-assembly with genetic linkage data improved contiguity more than six-fold and produced a chromosomal-level assembly of the A. atriplicis genome. For A. certus, scaffolding the de novo assembly with the GLS assembly of A. atriplicis increased its contiguity more than 2000-fold and produced a chromosomal-level assembly. Assembly completeness, as measured by percent complete, single-copy BUSCO hymenopteran genes, showed far less improvement and generally varied little among assemblies. Furthermore, the total numbers of genes identified in assemblies, the proportion of genes with homologs on GenBank, and the proportion of genes with Gene Ontology or InterProScan annotations, showed little improvement between assemblies. Nonetheless, increased contiguity of assemblies is important regardless of impact on gene annotation, for example, finding genes associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) and understanding chromosomal rearrangement associated with speciation both require highly contiguous assemblies., The genus Aphelinus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) comprises at least 94 species (Noyes 2019). From published host records, all Aphelinus species are internal parasitoids of aphids, and many Aphelinus species are used in biological control of pest aphids (Hopper et al. 1998, 2017a, 2017b). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected from D. noxia in the Caucasus region of southern Russia and introduced into the United States in 1991 to control this pest (Hopper et al. 1998). Aphelinus certus appeared in North America soon after the soybean aphid invaded and has spread throughout the region where soybean aphid is a pest (Heimpel et al. 2010). In the laboratory, A. atriplicis and A. certus are partially compatible: the species will mate with one another, and crosses produce viable, fertile F1 females (Heraty et al. 2007). When F1 females from crosses between A. certus females and A. atriplicis males are backcrossed to the parental species, they produce as many progeny as either parental species on their common host, Aphis glycines, but when F1 females from the reciprocal cross (A. atriplicis females × A. certus males) are backcrossed to the parental species, they produce half as many progeny as either parental species (Wu et al. 2004). In spite of this partial compatibility, A. atriplicis and A. certus are phylogenetically distinct and differ in courtship behavior, morphology, and host specificity (Heraty et al. 2007; Hopper et al. 2017a, 2017b). The populations of A. atriplicis and A. certus we studied differ by ∼4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which is four times greater than the intraspecific variation among 17 populations of A. certus (Hopper et al. 2019). Natural populations of A. atriplicis and A. certus are separated by 5000 km of deserts and mountains, including some of the highest mountain ranges in the world, thus their partial compatibility likely results from a lack of selection against hybridization (Heraty et al. 2007)., The parasitoids and aphids used in the research reported here were from cultures maintained at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware. The culture of A. atriplicis was started in 2000 with 101 adults from parasitized D. noxia collected in fields of Triticum sp. (wheat) near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia (permit P526P-20-03892). The A. certus culture was started in 2001 with 14 adults from parasitized Aphis glycines (soybean aphid) collected in fields of Glycine max (soybean) near Tsukuba City, Japan (permit P526P-18-04656). To help maintain genetic variation, each parasitoid culture was divided into 4–6 subcultures, and each subculture is maintained with an adult population size >200 (Roush and Hopper 1995)., The culture of A. glycines was started in 2004 with aphids collected from a soybean field near Newark, Delaware, while that of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from a culture at the University of Wyoming, which was started with aphids collected in southeastern Wyoming in 1992, 1994, and 1995. The aphid cultures are maintained as 18–36 subcultures with thousands of aphids per subculture. All cultures are kept in plant-growth chambers (model AR66L2, Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, USA) at 20°C, 40–70% relative humidity, and 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Aphelinus atriplicis is reared on D. noxia on Hordeum vulgare (barley) and A. certus on A. glycines on Glycine max (soybean). Vouchers of insect species are maintained at −20°C in molecular grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware., For assemblies of the genome of A. atriplicis, we used a combination of an Illumina paired-end (2 × 150 nt) library and PacBio long-read libraries, prepared with standard kits and protocols from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). To make an Illumina library of A. atriplicis, we extracted genomic DNA from an individual male, using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, that we then whole-genome amplified (WGA) the DNA with a REPLI-g Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Because Hymenoptera are haplo-diploid with males being hemizygous, using a single male ensured that this library would have no heterozygosity. To make the PacBio libraries of A. atriplicis, however, we had to extract genomic DNA from pooled adults because, at the time these libraries were made and sequenced, several micrograms of DNA were needed for the PacBio technology (Aphelinus species are small, yielding ∼100 ng DNA per adult). We used the Genomic Tip 20/G Kit (Qiagen) to extract DNA from a pool of 275 individuals for one library and 700 for the other. The libraries were prepared and sequenced at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, Newark, Delaware, using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and a PacBio RS. After size selection, the average PacBio-library fragment size was 35,290 bp (see Supplementary Figure S1)., After quality trimming with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014), analysis with FastQC showed that the Illumina library for A. atriplicis yielded 97 million reads with a length of 150 nt and a total of 15 billion nt of sequence. After subread and quality filtering, the PacBio libraries for A. atriplicis yielded ∼1 million reads with an N50 for subread length of 22 kb and a total of 19 billion nucleotides of sequence. Given the 353 Mb size of the A. atriplicis genome estimated from flow cytometry (Gokhman et al. 2017), the Illumina library should give 41-fold coverage, and the two PacBio libraries should give 54-fold coverage. The two PacBio libraries were combined, and consensus error-correction was done with CANU (using the options -correct and -genomeSize = 350 m; Koren et al., 2017; Figure 1, step 1). In most cases, the assemblies were better with error-corrected PacBio reads rather than raw reads., To make an Illumina library of A. certus, we extracted genomic DNA from a pool of 24 males that were sons of a single, unmated female, using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. We used pooled sons from a single, unmated female to reduce polymorphism, which should ease assembly, although there would be some polymorphism even among males from a single female. This being said, the A. certus assembly made with MaSuRCA using this library was actually more contiguous that the A. atriplicis assembly made with MaSuRCA using the library made from a single male. The library was prepared and sequenced at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, Newark, Delaware, using an Illumina HiSeq 2500. After quality trimming with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014), the library yielded 203 million reads with a length of 150 nt and a total of 30 billion nt of sequence. Given the 362-Mb size of the A. certus genome estimated from flow cytometry (Gokhman et al. 2017), this library should give 84-fold coverage., For A. atriplicis, several long-read assemblies were made with the assemblers CSA_assemble [Kuhl et al. 2020; pipeline that runs wtdbg2, Ruan and Li (2020)], Flye (Kolmogorov et al. 2019), MECAT2 (Xiao et al. 2017), Miniasm (Li 2016), Platanus-allee (Kajitani et al. 2019), and Raven (Vaser and Šikić 2020). Hybrid assemblies with Illumina and PacBio reads were made with MaSuRCA (Zimin et al. 2013), Wengan (Di Genova et al. 2021), and DBG2OLC (Ye et al. 2016), the latter uses Platanus (Kajitani et al. 2014) for the short-read assembly (Figure1, step 2). Where feasible, each assembler was run with both raw and corrected PacBio reads. Mecat has its own long-read error correction, and MaSuRCA uses short reads to correct long reads; thus, assemblies made with them were categorized as using error-corrected reads even though run with raw reads. The resulting assemblies were error-corrected with long-read error-correction using Flye (-polish option; Kolmogorov et al. 2019; Figure 1, step 3), to improve performance in downstream steps. (Details of the programs and versions used are in Supplementary Table S1, and parameters, commands, and scripts are in Supplementary Document S1.) These analyses and all the others described below, with the except of the gene ontology analysis, were done on the BIOMIX computational cluster at the University of Delaware Bioinformatics Core Facility., Each assembly was run through the HERA pipeline (Du and Liang 2019; Figure 1, step 4). HERA performs gap closing/scaffolding of assemblies using long reads by re-assembly of gaps and resolution of closely related repeats that were unresolved by the original assembler. HERA generally improved contiguity statistics threefold. The performance HERA was evaluated using different combinations of parameters to determine the optimal settings. First HERA scripts were modified to run on the Slurm workload manager on BIOMIX. Second, BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) was replaced with Minimap2 (Li 2018) for read mapping in the pipeline because the latter has similar performance for alignment of long reads but is much faster. Next the parameters evaluated were with a range of mapping settings for Minimap2 (−× asm10 vs −× asm20, i.e., align up to 10% vs 20% sequence divergence), minPathNum (minimum number of paths for contig pairs), minOverlap_Merge (minimum overlap needed to merge supercontigs and non-scaffolded contigs), and min_ctg_size (minimum contig size used in all vs all and all vs reads mapping). We ended up with parameter settings of −x asm20, minPathNum = 6, minOverlap_Merge = 5000, and min_ctg_size of 10,000., Following preliminary assessments, some low-quality assemblies were dropped. These included Platanus-allee, which made a large number of very short contigs that performed poorly with the HERA and ntJoin in downstream steps, Miniasm with raw reads, which produced a highly inflated assembly size, likely from raw reads being treated as paralogs, and Wengan, which made assemblies with sizes and N50 well below the other assemblies. This left 11 assemblies for meta-assembly., We compared the assemblies by evaluating sizes relative to estimates from flow cytometry, contiguity statistics from Quast (Mikheenko et al. 2018), core-gene completeness from BUSCO for Hymenoptera (Hymenoptera_odb10; Seppey et al. 2019), and number of misassemblies (Figure 1, step 5). The number of misassemblies was estimated by counting the number of contigs or scaffolds with genetic markers from different chromosomes. Although this estimate may fail to detect misassemblies where genetic markers are sparse, the A. atriplicis genome was fairly uniformly covered by genetic markers so our estimate should scale well with the true number of misassemblies. To rank the de novo assemblies, we calculated the ratios of the observed values to the best values for seven assembly statistics, including divergence from flow cytometry size, number of contigs, N50 (the length of shortest contig at which over half the genome is covered), L50 (the number of contigs covering half the genome), the length of the longest contig, the number of misassemblies, and BUSCO scores., The seven de novo assemblers used here employ five algorithms, including overlap-layout-consensus, fuzzy De Bruijn graph, repeat graph, string graph, and De Bruijn graph with overlap-layout-consensus. Five assemblers used long-read PacBio data and two used both short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio data. Lastly, we ran the assemblers with raw and error-corrected PacBio data. This diversity of algorithms, data types, and read processing was designed to capture of the maximum amount of information in our sequence data., The CSA assembly was chosen as a target for meta-assembly because it ranked highest among the initial assemblies. The CSA assembly was error-corrected with HyPo (long- and short-read error correction for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels; Kundu et al. 2019), which increased the accuracy of gene calls (based on BUSCO scores), as well as the number of genetic markers that mapped to the A. atriplicis genome for genetic map scaffolding. The CSA assembly was then used as the target assembly in ntJoin (Coombe et al. 2020; Figure 1, step 6) with the remaining 10 assemblies serving as references. ntJoin performs alignment-free scaffolding using structural synteny and can be used for several of purposes. In the present study, ntJoin identified all of the syntenic contigs among the input assemblies, allowing adjacent contigs to be ordered, oriented, and joined in the target assembly. Errors in the target assembly and discrepancies among the reference assemblies were resolved by consensus (all inputs were given equal weight), allowing misassemblies to be broken and repaired. Only sequences from the target assembly were scaffolded and output, thus there was no chance of sequence duplication or deletion, which can be a problem with some other assembly-reconciliation tools., The ntJoin algorithm does well at ordering and placing contigs together, but it fills the gaps between adjacent contigs with Ns. To replace these Ns with sequence data wherever possible, we ran the meta-assembly through TGS-GapCloser (Xu et al. 2020; Figure 1, step 7), which uses long reads to fill gaps between contigs on the same scaffold. This final set of scaffolds was polished using short reads with Pilon (Walker et al. 2014; Figure 1, step 8), which fixed local indels and improved the number of genetic markers that could later be uniquely mapped to the assembly., We tested various parameter values to optimize the performance of ntJoin. For our analysis, the best settings were w = 1000 (w is the window size for finding minimizers), no_cut=False (no_cut specifies whether the target assembly should be broken at areas of discrepancy), with target_weight (the weight given to the target assembly when determining the highest scoring path) and reference_weights (weights given to the references when determining the highest scoring path) all set equal to each other. This allowed discrepancies in the target assembly to be broken and did not give any preference to any of the reference assemblies., The genetic map used for scaffolding was generated as part of a QTL mapping project using the following procedures. We crossed an A. atriplicis male with an A. certus female and backcrossed 23 F1 females with 23 A. certus males to produce 320 backcross females in 23 families. To generate genetic markers, we made and sequenced reduced-representation libraries (RRL) of each of parent, grandparent, and backcross female. Such libraries can provide large numbers of sequence polymorphisms across many individuals at low cost (Baxter et al. 2011). To make these libraries, we modified a protocol from Baird et al. (2008). Genomic DNA was extracted from individual wasps using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits and then WGA with REPLI-g Kits, following kit protocols. An aliquot (1 μg) of the resulting DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases using one rare cutter (e.g., NgoMIV with a 6 bp recognition site) and one frequent cutter (e.g., CviQI with a 4-bp recognition site), which together determine the number of locations of fragments across the genome and the lengths of these fragments. Custom adaptors, with barcodes for each sample that also serve to register clusters on the Illumina HiSeq during sequencing, were ligated onto the fragments using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation products were pooled and purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit. The pooled ligate was size selected (300–350 bp) using the BluePippin system (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). The size-selected ligate was PCR amplified to both increase copy number at each locus and add more adaptor sequence. The adaptors were designed so only fragments with the rare-common combination of cut sites would amplify. After PCR, the product was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA), quantitated with qPCR, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, Newark, Delaware. The read sequences were analyzed using a custom pipeline written in Python that included quality trimming with FastQC (Andrews 2010), barcode deconvolution, mapping of reads to a draft genome assembly of A. atriplicis (see details below) with BWA (Li and Durbin 2010), and variant calling using the GATK UnifiedGenotyper (DePristo et al. 2011). The library preparation protocol and bioinformatic pipeline were described in Manching et al. (2017), and the code can be found at https://github.com/UD-CBCB/RedRep. We filtered the variant calls for SNP that (1) were fixed differences between the A. atriplicis and A. certus individuals used in the crosses, (2) had at least 10× coverage in at least 80% of the backcross females, and (3) had minor allele frequency of at least 30%. We ended up with marker data from 291 backcross females because some females were not scored for enough markers. Using R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) and the methods described in Broman (2010), we made a genetic linkage map with SNP markers from this RRL (Figure 1, step 9)., Using the ∼100 nt in each RLL locus where SNP markers were found, we mapped these loci to the meta-assembly scaffolds with BWA (Li and Durbin 2010). Eight RLL loci were dropped because they had poor mapping quality, three did not map at all, and 44 were dropped because they only partially aligned, leaving 779 RLL loci to be used for scaffolding. Using Chromonomer (Catchen et al. 2020), we scaffolded the meta-assembly of the A. atriplicis genome to the genetic map described above (Figure 1, step 10). This produced a chromosomal-level assembly for much of the A. atriplicis genome, which we will refer to as the GLS assembly. The 779 loci considered for scaffolding mapped to 48 contigs from the meta-assembly. Chromonomer used 224 loci to place and order the 48 contigs on 4 chromosomes. The other 555 loci were dropped by the program because their ordering was inconsistent within or between contigs. To get an idea of the completeness of each chromosome-level assembly, we estimated the amount of sequence in each chromosome from the 353-Mb genome size of A. atriplicis estimated from flow cytometry and the relative sizes of each chromosome in the karyotype of A. atriplicis (Gokhman et al. 2017). This gave size estimates of 141, 92, 64, and 55 Mb for each of the four chromosomes. We compared the amount of sequence assembled in each chromosome to these values to estimate the amount of missing sequence for each chromosome., To determine whether interspecies scaffolding would be useful, we made a de novo assembly of the genome of A. certus using MaSuRCa with Illumina paired-end reads. We scaffolded this assembly with ntJoin using the GLS assembly of A. atriplicis. We evaluated the assemblies of A. certus using the methods described above for the assemblies of A. atriplicis., To find any bacterial contamination in the final assemblies, we ran blastn with the assembly contigs against the NCBI nt database restricted to taxa in Insecta or Bacteria (using parameters -evalue 1e-25, -max_hsps 1, and -max_target_seqs 10; Altschul et al. 1997; Coordinators 2016). We then ran Blobtools (Laetsch and Blaxter, 2017) to assign the most likely taxa for the hits, and to visualize the contig GC contents and mapping depths compared to the assigned taxa. We removed the contigs with bacterial sequences from the final assemblies for down-stream analyses., We searched for repetitive DNA with GenomeScope (Ranallo-Benavidez et al. 2020), which uses input from Jellyfish (Marçais and Kingsford 2011). We also searched for transposons with the Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA) pipeline (Ou et al. 2019). This pipeline runs LTR_FINDER (Xu and Wang, 2007, Ou and Jiang, 2019), LTRharvest (Ellinghaus et al. 2008), and LTR_retriever (Ou and Jiang, 2018) to find all of the LTRs in the genome. It also runs Generic Repeat Finder (Shi and Liang, 2019), HelitronScanner (Xiong et al. 2014), and TIR-Learner (Su et al. 2019) to find non-LTR transposons. It then runs a series of filters and RepeatModeler (Flynn et al. 2020) to remove duplicates, identify full-length transposable elements (TEs), and create a final TE library. The EDTA pipeline identifies repeats de novo based on their sequences and the attributes of known TE families., To find the mitochondrial genome in the A. atriplicis assembly, we used blastn to compare the A. atriplicis assembly with the published assembly of the mitochondrial genome of Encarsia formosa (Zhu et al. 2018), which is in another genus of Aphelinidae which is the same family as Aphelinus. We identified one contig (ctg280) in the assembly of A. atriplicis that appeared to harbor the complete mitochondrial genome. We submitted this contig to Mitos2 (Donath et al. 2019) to identify mitochondrial features and determine their lengths and order., To find the mitochondrial genome in the A. certus assembly, we first used blastn to compare contig 280 from the A. atriplicis final assembly with the atriplicis-scaffolded assembly of A. certus. We found 12 contigs in the A. certus assembly that together appeared to harbor the complete mitochondrial genome. We concatenated these contigs in the order in which they occurred in contig 280, and we then used Mitos2 to identify mitochondrial features and determine their lengths and order., Using Augustus with the Nasonia gene model (Stanke et al. 2008), we identified protein coding regions in the CSA, meta, and GLS assemblies of A. atriplicis and in the MaSuRCa and GLS-scaffolded assemblies of A. certus (Figure 1, step 11). To determine the likely functions of these genes, we compared their amino acid sequences to proteins in the nr database (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using blastp (with the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, E-value = 0.001, and the default values for other parameters; Altschul et al. 1997; Coordinators 2016). We analyzed gene ontology annotations with blast2GO (Götz et al. 2008) and functional domains using InterProScan (Jones et al. 2014). We then compared the numbers of genes, functional annotations, and intron/exon structure among the assemblies., The de novo assemblies of A. atriplicis differed in values for seven representative metrics of genome completeness (Figure 2 and Table 1). Other metrics are given in Supplementary Table S2. The assemblies had better values for some metrics but not others. For example, the DBG2OLC assembly made with error-corrected data was closest in size to the estimate from flow cytometry and had the fewest contigs compared to other assemblies made using error-corrected data, but the CSA assembly made with error-corrected data had the highest values for five of the seven metrics and had the highest average ratio for these metrics for both raw and error-corrected data. The numbers of complete, single-copy BUSCO genes of Hymenoptera were high and differed little among assemblies (Table 1) and other BUSCO metrics also differed little among assemblies (Supplementary Table S2)., Comparisons of metrics for eleven de novo assemblies of the Aphelinus atriplicis genome., Comparisons of metrics for eleven de novo assemblies of the Aphelinus atriplicis genome.,  Seven completeness metrics for Aphelinus atriplicis genome assembled with seven assemblers.

ith raw data and seven assemblers with error-corrected data improved contiguity over the best single assembly, the CSA assembly made with error-corrected data (Table 2 and Figure 2). Other metrics for the meta-assembly are given in Supplementary Table S2. Meta-assembly increased N50 threefold, i.e., from 3 to 9 Mb, and decreased by L50 more than threefold, i.e., from 39 to 12. Much of this improvement arose because different assemblies had gaps in different places (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2). There were 45 gaps in the meta-assembly, with a mean size of 19 kb (range 10 bp to 130 kb) comprising 728,414 bp. Meta-assembly did not increase the amount of the genome captured compared to the size estimated from flow cytometry or the proportion of complete hymenopteran BUSCO genes captured., Contigs on Chromosome One in 11 de novo assemblies, meta-assembly, and genetic linkage-scaffolded assembly of Aphelinus atriplicis.

Analysis for SNPs in RLL loci with ≥10× coverage yielded 50,259 markers on 15,229 loci. Filtering for fixed differences between the A. atriplicis and A. certus individuals used in the crosses left 2200 SNP markers. Further filtering of markers for the presence in ≥80% of backcross females, Mendelian segregation, and no duplicate segregation, i.e., no markers on the same RRL locus, left 1328 markers that formed four linkage groups with >200 markers per group, while the remaining 18 markers were either unlinked or formed linkage groups with <5 markers. Ordering the markers on linkage groups and filtering for genotyping errors, left 834 markers in a genetic map 1776 cM long with a mean of 2 cM between markers and relative sizes of the linkage groups of 39%,27%, 18% and 15% of the genome. These sizes matched well the relative sizes of the four chromosomes (40%,26%,18%, 16% of the genome) in the A. atriplicis karyotype (Gokhman et al. 2017). Given the genetic map size and a flow-cytometry genome size of 353 Mb (Gokhman et al. 2017), the mean recombination rate was 5 cM/Mb., Of the 834 markers in our genetic map of A. atriplicis, we used 224 markers to place 48 meta-assembly scaffolds on chromosomes (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3). Together these scaffolds comprised 290 Mb, which is 85% of both the meta-assembly and GLS assembly sizes and 82% of the 353-Mb genome size estimated from flow cytometry. Of the sequence data in the meta-assembly, 53 Mb, i.e.,15%, could not be placed on chromosomes because 536 meta-assembly scaffolds lacked genetic markers. This left an 11-Mb difference between the sizes of the meta- and GLS assemblies and the 353 Mb estimated from flow cytometry. The percent of sequence captured on each chromosome in the GLS assembly differed among the chromosomes from flow-cytometry and karyotype: 75%,81%,95%,82%, respectively, for chromosomes 1,2,3, and 4., Genetic and physical maps of the Aphelinus atriplicis genome. Genetic map (shown in red) gives physical positions of 224 genetic markers that were used to scaffold 48 contigs (shown in alternating gray and black) in our meta-assembly that comprise 82% of the genome of A. atriplicis, as estimated from flow cytometry., Genetic and physical maps of the Aphelinus atriplicis genome. Genetic map (shown in red) gives physical positions of 224 genetic markers that were used to scaffold 48 contigs (shown in alternating gray and black) in our meta-assembly that comprise 82% of the genome of A. atriplicis, as estimated from flow cytometry., Genetic scaffolding increased N50 eight-fold from 9 to 74 Mb, and decreased L50 six-fold from 12 to 2 (Table 2). L75 was 4, number of chromosomes in A. atriplicis and other species in the varipes complex of Aphelinus (Gokhman et al. 2017). Although the average recombination rate across the genome was 5 cM/Mb, recombination rate varied within Chromonomer scaffolds from 1 to 60 cM/Mb with a median of 9 cM/Mb., Genetic scaffolding did not increase the amount of the genome captured compared to the size estimated from flow cytometry, but it did slightly increase the number of complete, single-copy hymenopteran BUSCO genes that were found (Table 2; Supplementary Table S2)., Scaffolding the de novo assembly of A. certus (made with Illumina data and MaSuRCa) using the GLS assembly of the A. atriplicis genome enormously improved the contiguity of the A. certus assembly (Table 3). Scaffolding reduced the number of contigs by half, increased the N50 2316-fold, decreased the L50 1303-fold, and L75 decreased to 4, the number of chromosomes in A. certus and other species in the Aphelinus varipes complex. Although scaffolding increased the assembly size by 5 Mb, this was still 7% smaller than the 362-Mb estimated from flow cytometry (Gokhman et al. 2017). Completeness, as measured by % complete, single-copy hymenopteran BUSCO genes, increased from 83% to 90%, which represents 409 core genes that have important, conserved functions.,  Change in assembly metrics with interspecific scaffolding, De novo assembly of Aphelinus certus using Illiumina data compared to that assembly scaffolded with GLS assembly of Apheiinus atriplicis.

BUSCO values are for complete single-copy orthologs in the hymenopteran set., The analysis with Blobtools showed very little bacterial contamination in the assemblies of the genomes of either Aphelinus species. The assembly of the A. atriplicis genome had 332 Mb of arthropod sequence, 9 Mb of unidentified sequence, and 1.9 Mb of bacterial sequence, the latter being 0.6% of the assembly size. The GC-by-coverage plot for A. atriplicis revealed two clusters of contigs with bacterial contamination (Supplementary Figure S4a), one which is Wolbachia (order Rickettsiales), a known endosymbiont of these Aphelinus species, and the other is Buchnera (order Enterobacterales), an endosymbiont of aphids. There were 66 contigs with Wolbachia sequences, together comprising 1.3 Mb, which is in the size range of the complete Wolbachia genome (Scholz et al. 2020). There were six contigs with Buchnera sequences, together comprising 0.6 Mb, which is the size of the Buchnera genome (Moran and Mira 2001). The Buchnera contamination probably resulted from residual material in the parasitoid guts of the large numbers of parasitoids used for PacBio sequencing., The assembly of the A. certus genome had 292 Mb of arthropod sequence, 42 Mb of unidentified sequence, and 1.9 Mb of bacterial sequence, the latter being 0.6% of the assembly size of 334 Mb. The GC-by-coverage plot for A. certus revealed several clusters of contigs with bacterial contamination (Supplementary Figure S4b), one which is Wolbachia. There were 338 contigs with Wolbachia sequences comprising 1.87 Mb, which is 0.2 Mb larger than the maximum size reported for the complete Wolbachia genome (Scholz et al. 2020). There were 24 contigs with other bacterial contaminants in the A. certus final assembly that comprised 0.07 Mb of sequence but did not include Buchnera. The difference in the presence of Buchnera between the A. atriplicis and A. certus assemblies likely results from the different numbers and sexes of individuals involved in library preparation: for the A. certus libraries, a small number of males were used, while for the A. atriplicis PacBio libraries, hundreds of females and males were used. Because Aphelinus females host-feed to get nutrients for egg production, adult females may have remains of aphids and aphid symbionts in their guts. Contigs annotated as harboring bacteria were removed from the final assemblies of the A. atriplicis and A. certus genomes and submissions of these assemblies to NCBI., Analyses of repetitive content with Jellyfish and GenomeScope identified 70 Mb of the A. atriplicis assembly and 62 Mb of the A. certus assembly as repetitive. Analysis with EDTA of the assembly of the A. atriplicis genome revealed 95 Mb or 28% of the assembly in TEs, including 53 Mb in DNA TEs, 41 Mb in LTR retrotransposons, and 1 Mb in MITEs. The major transponson families included the DNA TE mutator family (7%), helitrons (4%), and the LTR Gypsy family (7%). Almost all of the TEs were no longer intact, with only 1291 intact TEs out of 228,000 found, i.e., less than 1% were intact. This suggests most of the TEs are decaying and may be subsequently removed from the genome. In the assembly of the A. certus genome 67 Mb or 20% in TEs, including 52 Mb in DNA TEs, 13 Mb in LTR retrotransposons, and 2 Mb in MITEs. The lower amount of sequence in LTR retrotransposons in A. certus compared to A. atriplicis may be because LTRs are long and not fully assembled in A. certus., Using Mitos2 with contig 280 which harbored the mitochondrial genome of A. atriplicis, we found that the feature lists were almost identical between A. atriplicis and E. formosa, the only exceptions being one tRNA present in one assembly and not in the other and another tRNA with the opposite pattern. The feature lengths were identical or very similar between A. atriplicis and E. formosa, the one exception being the sequences for 16SrRNA which was shorter in the A. atriplicis assembly, and the feature orders were almost identical between A. atriplicis and E. formosa, the three exceptions being tRNAs (Supplementary Figure S5a). The mitochondrial feature list for A. certus was almost identical to that of E. formosa, the only exceptions being one tRNA present in one assembly and not in the other and another tRNA with the opposite pattern. The tRNAs involved were different from those in the A. atriplicis assembly. The feature lengths were identical or very similar between A. certus and E. formosa, the two exceptions being the sequences for 16SrRNA and NADH5 which were shorter in the A. certus assembly, and the orders of protein-coding genes and rRNAs were almost identical between A. certus and E. formosa, the one exception being NADH2 (Supplementary Figure S5b). However, the order of tRNAs was quite different between A. certus and E. formosa., We found about 29,000 genes in the CSA, meta, and GLS assemblies of A. atriplicis (Table 4). For each assembly, the sequences in these genes comprised 25–26% of the genome assemblies. Although meta-assembly and genetic scaffolding increased contiguity metrics, these improvements had little effect on the number of genes called, changing this by <2% (Table 4). However, 237 more genes were called in the meta-assembly than in the CSA assembly, and some of these genes could be important for evolution. Fewer genes were called in the GLS assembly than in meta-assembly presumably because the GLS assembly had the Wolbachia genome removed. Increased contiguity had almost no effect on the proportion of genes with homologs on GenBank, gene ontology mappings and annotations, or InterProScan annotations (Table 4)., Gene annotation metrics of assemblies, Gene annotation metrics of assemblies, Scaffolding the de novo assembly of A. certus with the GLS assembly of A. atriplicis greatly increased the contiguity of the A. certus assembly, and this affecting gene annotation. Although the number of genes decreased by 2003 or 7% from the meta-assembly to the atriplicis-scaffolded assembly of A. certus, the total length in genes increased by 7 Mb or 9% because the gene lengths increase by 17%. However, there was little or no change in the proportion of these genes with homologs on GenBank, GO mappings and annotations, or InterProScan annotations (Table 4)., Meta-assembly, also known as assembly reconciliation, is an increasingly popular approach to providing higher quality genome assemblies (Wences and Schatz 2015; Babb et al. 2017; Torresen et al. 2017; Patel et al. 2018; Song et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2020). Assembly reconciliation takes advantage of differences in the sequence information captured by assemblers that differ in how well they deal with coverage level, repetitive or duplicated sequences, and sequencing errors. This means assemblers may cover gaps between contigs produced by other assemblers. However, Alhakami et al. (2017) reported that several assembly-reconciliation programs did not consistently improve quality as measured by both contiguity and misassembly. Tang et al. (2020) reviewed some of the same assembly-reconciliation programs, proposed a new one, and found that theirs gave modest increases in contiguity and decreases in misassembly compared to the best de novo assembly and other assembly-reconciliation programs. Our results with ntJoin gave a meta-assembly with a threefold increase in contiguity and no misassemblies, and these are greater improvements than described by Alhakami et al. (2017) and Tang et al. (2020). However, ntJoin (Coombe et al. 2020) was published after Alhakami et al. (2017) and Tang et al. (2020) published their comparisons and were not included in their analyses. ntJoin uses an alignment-free method of minimizer graphs and resolves discrepancies using the path with support in the highest number of input assemblies, whereas other meta-assemblers are alignment based. We used seven assemblers, involving long-read PacBio data and short-read Illumina plus long-read PacBio data, and raw vs error-corrected PacBio reads to capture diverse information. Meta-assembly contiguity statistics improved as the number input assemblies was increased (Supplementary Figure S6). When only using two or three input assemblies, a meta-assembly can give results worse than any of the input assemblies because discrepancies between the assemblies cannot be resolved under equal weighting., Long-distance scaffolding with the Hi-C and other technologies has become available, is relatively cheap, and provides a much-used alternative to scaffolding with genetic linkage data (Neely et al. 2011; Burton et al. 2013). However, during the last decade, over 200 papers, including over 30 in 2020–2021, have been published on scaffolding assemblies with genetic linkage data in a wide variety of organisms, like fungi (Celton et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2021), wild and cultivated plants (Song et al. 2016; Bellinger et al. 2020; Bernhardsson et al. 2021; Paritosh et al. 2021), aquatic mollusks and arthropods (Dukic et al. 2016; Yin et al. 2020; Penaloza et al. 2021), fish (de los Rios-Perez et al. 2020; Kai et al. 2011), insects (Davey et al. 2016; Niehuis et al. 2010; Koseva et al. 2019; Wallberg et al. 2019), reptiles (Yurchenko et al. 2020), and wild and domesticated birds and mammals (Dodgson et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016; Batra et al. 2020; Hagen et al. 2020). Genetic maps have been published for nonparasitic species of Hymenoptera species (Hunt and Page 1995; Beye et al. 1999; Wilfert et al. 2006, 2007; Meznar et al. 2010; Sirvio et al. 2011; Stolle et al. 2011), and for hymenopteran parasitoids in particular (Laurent et al. 1998; Holloway et al. 2000; Niehuis et al. 2010; Pannebakker et al. 2011; Desjardins et al. 2013; Matthey-Doret et al. 2019; Ma et al. 2021; Ulrich et al. 2021). Genetic map size varied among these hymenopteran species from ∼450 cM for Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae; Niehuis et al. 2010; Pannebakker et al. 2011; Desjardins et al. 2013) to ∼3500 cM for Apis mellifera (Hunt and Page 1995; Beye et al. 1999). The genetic map size (1776 cM) we measured for A. atriplicis was intermediate between these extremes, and resembles the 1300 cM found for Cotesia typhae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae; Benoist et al. 2020) and the 1330 cM found for Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera; Trichogrammatidae; Laurent et al. 1998). Most of the variation in genetic map sizes arises from differences in recombination rates, which vary an order of magnitude from 1.5 cM/Mb for N. vitripennis to 19 cM/Mb for A. mellifera, rather from differences in the physical sizes of the genomes, which are similar for these two species. At 5 cM/Mb, the mean recombination rate for our GLS assembly of A. atriplicis was intermediate among the published values (for review, see Wilfert et al. 2007). In many cases, genetic maps were generated for reasons other than improving genomes assembly and primarily for mapping QTL. However, the linkage data have been successfully repurposed for scaffolding genomic assemblies, and indeed the genetic map we describe here was generated for mapping QTL. Genetic linkage has been used to scaffold an assembly of N. vitripennis to its chromosomes (Desjardins et al. 2013). Thus, although starting from scratch, Hi-C and other molecular technologies are cheaper than doing crosses or pedigrees to generate linkage maps, if one already has a genetic map the only cost for using it for scaffolding an assembly is the cost of bioinformatic analysis., Although detection and decontamination of the final assemblies revealed the complete genomes of Wolbachia in each Aphelinus species, it had very little effect on the statistics of genome assembly or gene annotation. This is because the contaminant DNA represented less than 1% of each final assembly. The greater fragmentation of both the Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes in the A. certus assembly compared to the A. atriplicis assembly not doubt reflects using only Illumina short-read sequencing for A. certus vs Illumina short-read plus PacBio long-read sequencing for A. atriplicis. This is particularly true because genetic-scaffolding did not help in assembly of either the Wolbachia genome or the mitochrondrial genome. Both genomes ended up as unscaffolded contigs in both species, which is not surprising given that the genetic map used for scaffolding was based on meiotic recombination absent in Wolbachia or mitochondria., Increased contiguity of the assemblies of A. atriplicis had little effect on assembly completeness, as measured by percentage of complete BUSCO hymenopteran genes. This lack of effect arose either because most, if not all, of the complete BUSCO genes in A. atriplicis were found in the de novo assembly with CSA or because a small number of such genes were present but not found in the more contiguous assemblies either. The BUSCO gene set for Hymenoptera (odb10) comprises 5991 genes, which is one-fifth of all the genes we identified in A. atriplicis. Whether these core genes would be identified more readily than the remaining genes is unclear. However, increased contiguity also led to little or no increases in the numbers of other genes we identified or the numbers with annotations. Again, this could be because all genes were identified in the de novo assembly with CSA, leaving few additional genes to call in more contiguous assemblies or because genes present, but not found, in the de novo assembly were also not found in the more contiguous assemblies. The CSA assembly did not include 3.2 Mb of sequence (about 1%) that was in the GLS assembly. This included 310 kb of gene sequence with 43% being intronic. This suggests that the more contiguous assembly did not add much coding sequence. Although there were 45 gaps in the meta-assembly and an additional 44 gaps in the GLS assembly, together these comprised about 0.7 Mb of sequence data. Thus, these gaps were neither numerous nor large enough to have much effect on gene identification or annotation., Comparative genomics can inform assembly of genomes of closely related species (Coombe et al. 2020; Waterhouse et al. 2020). In the present study, scaffolding a low-contiguity de novo assembly of A. certus with the high-contiguity GLS assembly of the A. atriplicis, greatly improved contiguity of the A. certus assembly. In a way, this is not surprising, given that these two species have similar genome sizes (Gokhman et al. 2017), are close phylogenetically (Heraty et al. 2007), and can hybridize in the laboratory (Heraty et al. 2007). However, the amount of improvement in contiguity surprised us: over 2000-fold increase in N50 and over 1000-fold decrease in L50. Increased contiguity provided modest improvements in assembly completeness. The percentage of complete single-copy BUSCO hymenopteran genes increased by 7% or 410 genes. Furthermore, the total sequence identified as genes increased, and while the number of genes declined, gene length increased, which together suggests greater accuracy of gene models and less gene fragmentation., Although increased contiguity had no effects on the numbers of genes called or annotated for A. atriplicis and only modest effects for A. certus, increase contiguity would be very useful for other purposes. As Waterhouse et al. (2020) have recently pointed out, increased contiguity would aid in identifying genes associated with QTL and determining how evolution has affected chromosome structure, including fusions, splits, and other rearrangements, which could in turn affect reproductive isolation and thus speciation. Indeed, the reasons we have assembled these and other genomes of Aphelinus are to find QTL and the underlying genes involved in the evolution of host specificity and climatic adaptation and to study mechanisms of reproductive isolation among the many closely related species in this genus., Our results showed that meta-assembly of multiple assemblies based on short-read and long-read libraries with different assemblers increases assembly contiguity. However, genetic-linkage scaffolding of the meta-assemblies increases contiguity by orders of magnitude. We cannot say whether other methods of scaffolding would give similar or better effects on contiguity., DNA sequence data and final assemblies are archived at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) under BioProject number PRJNA767831., Supplementary material is available at G3 online., We thank Karol Miaskiewicz at University of Delaware Bioinformatics Core Facility for help with the BIOMIX computational cluster and Bruce Kingham, Olga Shevchenko, and Erin Bernberg at the DNA Sequencing & Genotyping Center of the Delaware Biotechnology Institute for assistance with preparing and sequencing DNA libraries.

During development and in cancer, cells either migrate as single cells or as interconnected small to large groups of cells called collectives (Friedl and Gilmour 2009; Friedl et al. 2012; Scarpa and Mayor 2016; Te Boekhorst et al. 2016b). Especially in cancer, cells can interconvert their modes of movement, transitioning from collective to single cell movement and back (Te Boekhorst and Friedl 2016a). A wide variety of cancer cells, including breast, colorectal, and thyroid carcinomas, are now known to migrate and invade as collectives both in vitro and in vivo (Cheung and Ewald 2016a; Wang et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2017; Ilina et al. 2018; Libanje et al. 2019; Padmanaban et al. 2019). Recent work has shown that tumor cell collectives promote tumor invasion and metastasis and may provide a mechanism for resistance to radiation (Aceto et al. 2014; Cheung et al. 2016b; Haeger et al. 2020)., The Drosophila border cells, which migrate collectively during late oogenesis, are a simple and genetically tractable model to identify genes required for collective cell migration (Montell et al. 2012; Saadin and Starz-Gaiano 2016). The border cell cluster consists of 4–8 epithelial-derived follicle cells that surround a central pair of polar cells (Figure 1, A–C and F). Individual border cells stay adhered together and their movement is coordinated as an entire unit during the 3- to 4-h journey to the oocyte (Figure 1, A–C). Multiple studies have used border cells to identify conserved genes that contribute to the migration of a variety of cancer cells, including those that invade as collectives (Yoshida et al. 2004; Madsen et al. 2015; Stuelten et al. 2018; Volovetz et al. 2020)., Screen to identify conserved GBM-associated adhesion genes in collective cell migration.

(G) Experimental flow chart used to identify novel GBM-associated adhesion genes through Drosophila and human glioma databases., Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor (Ostrom et al. 2014) and is refractory to many therapies including radiation and chemotherapy (Bao et al. 2006, Chen et al. 2012). Given the dismal prognosis of GBM, identifying the underlying mechanisms that drive progression, including cell invasion, remains an immediate priority. While many genes are known to be dysregulated in glioma patients, it is difficult to know which ones are most relevant to disease progression, including tumor invasion. We and others recently showed that glioma cells and GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs), which can drive tumor growth, migrate collectively in some contexts (Gritsenko et al. 2017; Gritsenko and Friedl 2018; Volovetz et al. 2020). Using several patient derived GBM CSC tumor models, we found that a gene required in border cells, the small GTPase Rap1, also contributes to GBM collective cell invasion (Chang et al. 2018; Sawant et al. 2018; Volovetz et al. 2020). Due to their cellular conservation and large degree of genetic homology with humans, Drosophila brain tumor models have been established and used to provide critical molecular insight into gliomas (Agnihotri et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018; Chen and Read 2019; Chi et al. 2019; Gangwani et al. 2020). Because patient derived GBM CSC tumor models are less genetically accessible for screening approaches, and Drosophila glioma models entail multiple mutations, we turned to border cells as an initial simpler approach to identify conserved genes that may drive GBM collective tumor invasion but that may also have a more general role in collective cell migration., Cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesions are critical for cells to stay together and move collectively in vivo (Friedl and Mayor 2017; Janiszewska et al. 2020). Thus, genes that regulate cell adhesion are strong candidates to promote collective cell cohesion, migration, and invasion. Here, we used the border cell system to screen a subset of adhesion and adhesion-related genes that have the potential to regulate GBM tumor migration and invasion. We selected conserved adhesion genes, genes associated with cell junctions, and genes that regulate cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion. We further focused on those adhesion-related genes whose expression correlated with glioma patient survival but at the time of the screen did not have known functions in brain cancer. We performed an RNAi screen targeting 23 of these adhesion genes in border cells. Here, we report the identification of eight genes, α-catenin (α-Cat), Symplekin (Sym), Lachesin (Lac), roughest (rst), dreadlocks (dock), Wnt4, dachsous (ds), and fat (ft), whose knockdown disrupted border cell migration and/or cluster cohesion to differing degrees. We then identified three human orthologs of target genes that were enriched in the leading edge (LE) and invasive portion of GBM tumors, the α-Cat ortholog CTNNA2, the Lac ortholog NEGR1, and the Rst ortholog KIRREL3. While further work needs to be done to test these genes in GBM tumors, this study supports the use of Drosophila genetic approaches to provide insights into human diseases such as GBM., FlyBase FB2014_5 version (released September 9, 2014) was queried for adhesion genes using the following gene ontology (GO) controlled vocabulary (CV) terms: “apical junction complex,” “focal adhesion,” “cell adhesion molecule binding,” “cell junction maintenance,” “cell junction assembly,” and “cell–cell adherens junction.” A total of 133 Drosophila genes were identified. Human orthologs were identified by Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) scores (Hu et al. 2011; Table 1). A PubMed search was performed for these genes along with “glioma,” “GBM,” or “brain cancer” to eliminate genes with a known function in or association with these cancers. This step narrowed the list to 44 genes. The NCBI REMBRANDT database was next used to identify genes that are associated with brain cancer patient survival; these results were then confirmed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genes associated with better (“positive”), or worse (“negative”) patient survival were selected. These analyses resulted in 23 conserved fly genes (34 human genes) that were the final candidate genes tested in the in vivo border cell RNAi screen., Drosophila and human brain tumor-associated adhesion genes, References are in Supplementary File S1., ND, not determined; NA, not available., Drosophila and human brain tumor-associated adhesion genes, References are in Supplementary File S1., ND, not determined; NA, not available., Regional gene expression data from GBM tumor tissue was obtained from the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) database (https://glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org/static/home, accessed June 20, 2021), which contains gene expression data from several anatomical features of GBM tumors in a 41-patient dataset. Analysis of gene expression based on glioma grade (grades II, III, and IV) was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data downloaded from the Gliovis data portal (http://gliovis.bioinfo.cnio.es/, accessed May 5, 2021). The GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis; http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/, accessed March 30, 2021) database (Tang et al. 2017) was used to compare differential expression of gene orthologs in GBM tumor tissue (n = 163) and nontumor brain tissue (n = 207). Thresholds were set at a log2 fold change > 1 and a P-value < 0.01., All genetic crosses were set up at 25°C. The tub-GAL80ts (“tsGAL80”) transgene (McGuire et al. 2004) was included to prevent early GAL4-UAS expression and potential lethality at larval or pupal stages of development. c306-GAL4, tsGal80; Sco/CyO was used to drive UAS-RNAi line expression in border cells. UAS-mCherry RNAi crossed to c306-GAL4 tsGal80; Sco/CyO was used as a control. The expression pattern of c306-GAL4 was confirmed by crossing c306-GAL4, tsGal80; Sco/CyO to UAS-nls.GFP (BDSC 4776). Multiple RNAi lines for the 23 cell adhesion candidate genes and UAS-mCherry RNAi were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) or the Harvard Transgenic RNAi Project (TRiP) collection from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC). All lines with stock numbers and construct IDs are listed in Table 2. Males from each UAS-RNAi line were crossed to virgin c306-GAL4, tsGal80 females. Three-to-five-day old F1 progeny females (c306-GAL4, tsGAL80/+; +/UAS-RNAi) from these crosses were fattened on wet yeast paste for ≥14 h at 29°C prior to dissection. This allowed maximum GAL4-UAS expression and full inactivation of tsGAL80. Each RNAi line was tested one time in the primary screen, with a subset of lines tested at least three times in the secondary screen unless otherwise noted (Table 2)., Results of the border cell RNAi screen, Schizo, Shroom, Schizo, Shroom, Positive hits from the border cell RNAi screen are in bold text; ND, not determined; NA, stock not available to retest; SD, standard deviation; ¥, Overlapping target sequences either partial or identical; *, Same construct but independent insertions; §, RNAi line tested in two trials (stock dead or no longer available at the stock center); #, data from Chen et al., 2020; †, Stock no longer available and the targeted sequence is unknown., Results of the border cell RNAi screen, Schizo, Shroom, Schizo, Shroom, Positive hits from the border cell RNAi screen are in bold text; ND, not determined; NA, stock not available to retest; SD, standard deviation; ¥, Overlapping target sequences either partial or identical; *, Same construct but independent insertions; §, RNAi line tested in two trials (stock dead or no longer available at the stock center); #, data from Chen et al., 2020; †, Stock no longer available and the targeted sequence is unknown., Ovaries were dissected in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After dissection, ovaries were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 10 min. NP40 block (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was used for intermediate washes and antibody dilutions. Primary antibodies were obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA) and used at the following dilutions: rat monoclonal anti-E-Cadherin 1:10 (DCAD2), mouse monoclonal anti-Armadillo 1:100 (N27A1), and mouse monoclonal anti-Singed 1:25 (Sn7C). Anti-rat or isotype-specific anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 or -568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used at 1:400 dilution. 4’,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Millipore Sigma) was used at 2.5 µg/ml to label nuclei. Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.) was used to mount egg chambers on slides, a coverslip was added, and the mounting media allowed to harden for 3 days prior to microscope imaging. The stained egg chambers were imaged either using an upright Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope with Apotome.2 optical sectioning or on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope (KSU College of Veterinary Medicine Confocal Core), using a 20x 0.75 numerical aperture (NA) objective. Images were processed in Zeiss ZEN 2 or FIJI software. Figures were prepared in Adobe Photoshop 2021 and line drawings were made in Adobe Illustrator 2021 or Affinity Design., Graphs were prepared in GraphPad Prism 8 and GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). For the secondary screen and subsequent analyses, three trials were performed for each RNAi line (n ≥ 30 egg chambers scored in each trial). The cutoff value for a migration defect was calculated based on the background mean migration defect (3% ±0.02) in control egg chambers (c306-GAL4 tsGAL80/+; +/UAS-mCherry RNAi). To determine genuine “hits” from the screen, RNAi lines with ≥10% migration defects were scored as positive hits in the primary and secondary screens. P-values were calculated using an unpaired two-tailed t-test in Microsoft Excel. For GBM regional and grade-dependent gene expression analyses, differences between groups were determined using a one-way ANOVA. N’s and P-values for each trial are included in the figure legends and tables., Cell–cell adhesion is essential for cells to stay connected during cohesive collective migration (Friedl and Mayor 2017). Reduction (or loss) of adhesion genes, such as E-cadherin (Drosophila shotgun [shg]), disrupts the integrity of the cluster and blocks the migration of the border cell cluster to the oocyte (Figure 1, D and E) (Niewiadomska et al. 1999; Sarpal et al. 2012; Desai et al. 2013; Cai et al. 2014; Raza et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020). Many adhesion genes are conserved from flies to humans and could contribute to both border cell migration and GBM invasion (Figure 1F). To identify these conserved adhesion genes, we first performed a search of the Drosophila genome (FB2014_05), using GO CV terms associated with cell adhesion (see Materials and Methods for details; Figure 1G). It is important to note that while these “adhesion-related” candidate genes were originally chosen due to their known or predicted roles in cell adhesion, many of these genes have additional cellular roles, including cell-ECM interactions, cell signaling, cell polarity, as well as other functions. From the 133 fly genes associated with one or more of these terms, we identified likely human orthologs by analyzing their DIOPT scores (Table 1; Hu et al. 2011). Using these human orthologs, we performed a PubMed search for those genes to determine if there was an already-known association with either glioma or GBM. This allowed us to focus on genes that may have a novel association with brain tumors. The remaining 44 genes were then analyzed in the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT), a database for transcript expression levels that are associated with brain tumor patient survival (Gusev et al. 2018). Ten genes were not found in REMBRANDT. Of the remaining 34 human genes, expression of 18 genes (13 fly genes) were associated with better (“positive”) patient survival while expression of 16 genes (13 fly genes) were associated with worse (“negative”) patient survival (Table 1). Many fly genes have multiple human orthologs. A few of these, for example α-cat, G protein alpha i subunit, and G protein alpha o subunit, have multiple human orthologs each of whose expression is associated with different predicted glioma patient outcomes (Table 1). For comparison, we have included any current known roles for these genes in cell migration or glioma (Table 1; Supplementary File S1). The 23 unique fly genes were chosen for further follow-up to determine their role, if any, in border cell collective migration., For the primary screen, multiple RNAi lines were used to specifically target and knock down each of the 23 conserved fly adhesion and adhesion-related genes in border cells (Table 2). These lines include independent targeted sequences, overlapping targeted sequences, and independent insertions of the same RNAi construct (see Table 2). Some RNAi lines used in this screen were validated in different Drosophila systems, whereas others have not yet been reported in published studies (FlyBase; Supplementary Table S1 and File S2). We drove expression of the respective UAS-RNAi lines using c306-GAL4 tsGAL80, a follicle cell driver highly enriched in border cells prior to and during their migration; tsGAL80 was used to bypass potential early lethality (Figure 1, A–C). All border cell clusters from control (c306-GAL4 tsGAL80/+; +/UAS-mCherry RNAi) egg chambers completed their migration by stage 10 (Figure 2, A and B; Table 2). Twenty-one of these genes displayed a migration defect above the minimum cutoff of ≥10% with at least one RNAi line (see Materials and Methods)., Cell adhesion and cell junction-associated genes whose RNAi knockdown impairs border cell migration.

Each RNAi line was crossed to c306-GAL4 tsGAL80 three times and scored for the ability of border cells to complete their migration to the oocyte. For three genes (ds, Lac, and rst), additional RNAi lines were obtained from stock centers and tested. We specifically analyzed if RNAi border cells failed to initiate migration (“no migration”), stopped along the migration pathway but did not reach the oocyte (“partial migration”), reached the oocyte (“complete migration”), or if clusters had defective cohesion and split into multiple parts (“% splitting”). Control border cells completed their migration to the oocyte by stage 10 (Figures 2, A and B and 3, A and B; Table 2). We found that knockdown of eight genes, α-Cat, Sym, Lac, rst, dock, Wnt4, ds, and ft, consistently disrupted border cell migration with at least two RNAi lines, providing more confidence that these genes are required for collective cell migration (Figures 2 and 3; Table 2). Border cell migration defects upon knockdown of these genes ranged from 10% to 76% depending on the gene and the RNAi line; some RNAi lines for these genes had less than 10% migration defects.

E-cadherin is required for adhesion of border cells to the nurse cell substrate, which provides traction for border cells to keep moving forward and thus facilitates forward movement while maintaining tension-based directional motility (Niewiadomska et al. 1999; Cai et al. 2014). α-Cat was the strongest candidate from our primary screen (Table 2), and we recently described the phenotypes for α-Cat knockdown in detail (Chen et al. 2020). α-Cat was knocked down using two independent RNAi lines, which reduced α-Cat protein levels in border cells (Chen et al. 2020). α-Cat RNAi strongly disrupted migration, with 66–76% border cells failing to complete their migration (Figure 2, C, D, and M; Table 2). Border cell clusters deficient for α-Cat also had significant cohesion defects, with the cluster splitting into two or more parts in 35% of egg chambers (Figure 2, C and D). Thus, Drosophila α-Cat is required for both successful border cell migration and for proper cohesion of cells within the cluster (this study; Sarpal et al. 2012; Desai et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2020). The role for α-Cat in cluster cohesion and migration closely resembles that of β-Cat (Drosophila Armadillo) and E-cadherin, thus it is likely that α-Cat functions in the classical cadherin-catenin complex in border cells (Niewiadomska et al. 1999; Sarpal et al. 2012; Desai et al. 2013; Cai et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2020)., Other junctional genes: Four genes, Sym, Lac, rst, and dock, encode proteins that localize to various types of cell junctions and/or are known to regulate cell adhesions. Sym (human SYMPK) is a scaffolding protein, which along with other polyadenylation factors, forms a complex that mediates processing of polyadenylated and histone mRNAs but also functions at tight junctions (Keon et al. 1996; McCrea et al. 2009; Sullivan et al. 2009). During Drosophila oogenesis, Sym is required for histone pre-mRNA processing in the histone locus body during endoreplication of the follicular epithelium (Tatomer et al. 2014). Later in oogenesis, Sym protein localizes to the tricellular junctions of follicle cells. Here, Sym may facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation and thus translation of mRNAs required to regulate and/or maintain adhesion at cell junctions (Tatomer et al. 2014). Border cells expressing Sym RNAi had significant migration defects along with splitting of the cluster (Figure 2, E, F, and N; Table 2). The two strongest Sym RNAi lines (VDRC 33469 and 33470), which target the same region of the Sym gene, caused significant migration defects, with 5–10% of border cells failing to start migration and an additional 18–22% failing to reach the oocyte. Sym RNAi border cell clusters had cohesion defects, with 11% of clusters visibly splitting apart. A third independent RNAi line (BL 39041) did not impair migration (Figure 2N). Based on our observed phenotypes and the known roles for Sym, we speculate that Sym may maintain cell–cell contacts between border cells during collective migration, possibly through regulation of as-yet-unknown targets by mRNA polyadenylation at cell–cell junctions., Lac (human LSAMP and NEGR1) is a membrane-localized protein with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains that can mediate cell–cell adhesion (Finegan and Bergstralh 2020). Lac localizes to both immature and mature basolateral septate junctions and is required for tracheal morphogenesis in Drosophila (Llimargas et al. 2004). Knockdown of Lac by four RNAi lines, which together target two nonoverlapping regions of the Lac gene, mildly disrupted migration and cohesion of the cluster (Figure 2, G, H, and O; Table 2). Two Lac RNAi lines (VDRC 35524 and BL 28940) disrupted migration in 11% of egg chambers, whereas two RNAi lines (VDRC 107450 and BL 38536) had fewer migration defects and were not significantly different from control (Figure 2O; Table 2). While the phenotypes caused by Lac RNAi knockdown are mild, recent work by Alhadyian et al. found that four additional septate junction proteins, Macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr), Contactin, Neurexin-IV and Coracle, localize to border cells and are required for both border cell cluster migration and cohesion (Alhadyian et al. 2021). Because border cells do not have mature septate junctions (which form the tight occluding junctions), septate junction proteins may instead regulate cluster polarity and/or adhesion during migration (Alhadyian et al. 2021). Thus, Lac is likely to have a specific role in border cell migration along with other septate junction proteins. Further work will be needed to determine if the mild phenotypes observed with Lac RNAi are due to partial knockdown or to redundancy with other septate junction genes., Rst (human KIRREL1, KIRREL2, and KIRREL3) is a member of the Irre Cell Recognition Module (IRM) family of transmembrane proteins. In particular, Rst encodes an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) with five Ig-like domains (Finegan and Bergstralh 2020). IRM proteins, including Rst, control the adhesion and patterning of various tissues including the developing ommatidia in the Drosophila eye (Bao and Cagan 2005; Johnson et al. 2011; Finegan and Bergstralh 2020).

e RNAi lines (VDRC 27223, VDRC 27225, and BL 28672), which in total target two nonoverlapping regions of the rst gene. Migration defects ranged from 10% to 16% (Figure 2, I, J, and P; Table 2). Cluster cohesion was mildly affected (6% of clusters split apart; Figure 2I). A fourth RNAi line did not disrupt migration or cohesion compared to control (Figure 2P; VDRC 951). Interestingly, Rst is required for progression through Drosophila adult oogenesis, including development of the germline (Valer et al. 2018; Ben-Zvi and Volk 2019). Rst is also expressed in follicle cells prior to the stages that border cells develop from the follicle cell epithelium (Valer et al. 2018), further supporting a later role in border cell migration., Dock (human NCK1) is an SH2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, actin regulation, cell adhesion, and other processes (Buday et al. 2002; Chaki and Rivera 2013). In Drosophila, Dock regulates axon guidance, myoblast fusion during embryonic development, and ring canal morphogenesis in the ovarian germline-derived nurse cells (Garrity et al. 1996; Rao and Zipursky 1998; Kaipa et al. 2013; Stark et al. 2021). Knockdown of dock in border cells, using two independent RNAi lines that target nonoverlapping regions of the dock gene (VDRC 37524 and BL 27728), resulted in migration defects but did not disrupt cohesion of border cells (Figure 2, K, L, and Q; Table 2). Specifically, dock RNAi disrupted migration in 13–19% of stage 10 egg chambers (Figure 2Q; Table 2). One RNAi line (VDRC 107064) did not impair border cell migration but showed mild splitting (6%), whereas another line (VDRC 37525) from the primary screen was no longer available so could not be confirmed in the secondary screen (Figure 2Q; Table 2). Dock is required for myoblast fusion during muscle formation by regulating cell adhesion and F-actin (Kaipa et al. 2013). In this context, Dock colocalizes with and/or binds to several cell adhesion proteins from the IgCAM superfamily including Rst, one of the genes identified in this screen (see above). In addition, Dock genetically and biochemically interacts with the Ste20-like serine-threonine kinase Misshapen (Msn) to control motility of photoreceptor growth cones in the developing eye (Ruan et al. 1999). Notably, Msn is required for border cell migration, where it is required for the formation of polarized protrusions and coordinated actomyosin contractility of the cluster (Plutoni et al. 2019). Thus, it will be of interest in the future to determine if Dock, Rst, and Msn interact to control border cell migration., Atypical cadherins and planar cell polarity genes: Three genes, Wnt4, ds, and ft encode proteins with annotated roles in both planar cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion (FlyBase; Figure 3; Table 2). Wnt4 (human WNT9A) is a conserved secreted protein of the Wnt family, which regulates cell adhesion through recruitment of focal adhesion complexes during the migration of epithelial cells in the pupal ovary (Cohen et al. 2002). We tested four RNAi lines for Wnt4, which in total target two independent regions of the gene. Migration defects for the four tested Wnt4 RNAi lines ranged from 9% to 23% (Figure 3, C, D, and I; Table 2). These data suggest a role for Wnt4 in regulating border cell movement. Previous studies suggested that Wnt4 participates in establishing planar polarity within the developing eye and wing (Lim et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2013). Indeed, several core planar cell polarity genes including frizzled and disheveled regulate border cell migration (Bastock and Strutt 2007). However, recent studies that used multiple gene knockouts now indicate that the Wnt family of proteins, including Wnt4, are not required for Drosophila planar cell polarity (Ewen-Campen et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020). Thus, we favor a role for Wnt4 in the movement and adhesion of border cells, similar to what was found during earlier stages of Drosophila ovarian development (Cohen et al. 2002)., Ds (human DCHS1) and Ft (human FAT4) encode large protocadherin proteins, each of which has multiple extracellular cadherin repeats (27 for Ds and 34 for Ft) (Fulford and McNeill 2020). Heterophilic binding between Ds and Ft via their extracellular domains is essential for cell–cell communication, particularly in the regulation of tissue growth through Hippo signaling and planar polarization of various tissues (Matakatsu and Blair 2004; Bosveld et al. 2016; Blair and McNeill 2018; Fulford and McNeill 2020). Knockdown of ds with any of three independent RNAi lines (VDRC 36219, VDRC 4313, and BL 32964) mildly disrupted migration, ranging from 12% to 14% of border cells failing to reach the oocyte (Figure 3, E, F, and J; Table 2). ds RNAi border cell clusters only displayed mild cohesion defects, with 5% of clusters splitting apart (Figure 3E). Two independent RNAi lines that target ft (VDRC 108863 and VDRC 9396) also showed consistent though mild migration defects (11–13%), with only a few clusters (3%) splitting apart (Figure 3, G, H, and K; Table 2). Interestingly, ds is required for the collective directional migration of Drosophila larval epidermal cells (LECs) during morphogenesis of the pupal abdominal epithelium (Bischoff 2012; Arata et al. 2017). An imbalance in Ds protein levels between LECs during collective migration is detected by Ft at cell junctions leading to the formation of lamellipodia at the posterior side of the LECs (Arata et al. 2017). Further experiments will be needed to determine if Ft and Ds similarly coordinate protrusions in border cells or regulate some other aspect of border cell collective migration., The RNAi screen approach used in this study allows rapid functional testing of genes but comes with technical limitations (Perrimon et al. 2010; Booker et al. 2011). Possible caveats of RNAi-mediated knockdown include potential off-target effects (“false positives”), RNAi constructs that fail to knock down a given gene’s function (“false negatives”), genomic-insertion effects that reduce expression of an RNAi transgene and thus knockdown efficiency, transient or partial functional knockdown in cells and tissues by a given RNAi transgene, and/or compensation by related genes. We attempted to address some of these potential RNAi issues. To control for general activation of the RNAi machinery, we performed RNAi knockdown to monomeric Cherry (mCherry), a fluorescent protein not normally found in Drosophila (e.g., Figure 2, A, B, and M; Table 2). Whenever possible, to provide better confidence of RNAi-mediated knockdown results, we tested multiple RNAi lines for each gene, which include RNAi transgenes that target independent gene regions and independent insertions that target overlapping gene sequences (Table 2). Many of these RNAi lines have been used in other Drosophila screens and other functional studies, with various phenotypes observed such as pupal lethality, bristle defects, and others (FlyBase; Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary File S2)., Partial functional knockdown could also be due to expression levels of the GAL4-UAS system itself. We included tsGAL80 in our genetic crosses to prevent early GAL4-UAS-RNAi expression and potential lethality prior to the stages of oogenesis when border cells migrate. Under the experimental conditions of the screen (see Materials and Methods), it is possible that leaky tsGAL80 could further dampen expression of GAL4-UAS-RNAi in border cells. However, we have previously used the same GAL4 line, c306-GAL4, in combination with tsGAL80 under similar experimental conditions to drive RNAi-mediated knockdown in border cells; RNAi for at least two genes reduced levels of the respective proteins within border cells (Aranjuez et al. 2012, 2016). As with all RNAi screens, further follow-up experiments with loss-of-function mutant alleles or cell-specific CRISPR-Cas9 are needed to confirm the specificity of the phenotypes (Mohr et al. 2014). Future experiments include performing live cell imaging and other cellular assays to determine when each of these genes is required and how the genes precisely regulate collective border cell migration., Based on the results of the functional Drosophila screen, we next sought to link individual genes to invasion in human GBM patient tumors. We first assessed the Ivy GAP database that provides regional RNA expression across anatomically defined regions of tumors ranging from the tumor core to the infiltrating edge (see Materials and Methods). Using this database, we found that NEGR1 and KIRREL3 were specifically enriched in anatomical regions with elevated invasion potential, namely the leading edge (LE) and infiltrating tumor (IT), compared to all other assessed anatomical regions (Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S2). These regions included cellular tumor (CT), perinecrotic zone (PNZ), pseudopalisading cells around necrosis (PAN), hyperplastic blood vessels (HBV), and microvascular proliferation (MP). In addition, CTNNA2 had significant expression in the LE and IT regions though was also expressed in other regions of the tumor (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S2). However, we also observed some Drosophila screen hits that did not demonstrate regional heterogeneity in terms of expression, such as SYMPK and CTNNA1 (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S2). Other genes had a mixture of expression profiles across human GBM anatomical regions (CTNNA3, DCHS1, FAT4, and KIRREL1, KIRREL2, NCK1; Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S2). WNT9A was not found in the Ivy GAP database. It is worth noting that this initial validation approach takes advantage of regional differences within the same GBM tumor. Therefore, such GBM anatomical expression surveys may be a better surrogate of cellular invasion than expression in GBM compared to lower grade or nonneoplastic neural tissue; these latter analyses rely on gene expression in tissue obtained mainly from the core of the tumor and may miss areas of the tumor that undergo active invasion (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Nonetheless, we observed a variety of human adhesion ortholog gene-dependent increases or decreases in GBM tumors compared to lower-grade or nonneoplastic neural tissue (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Together, these assessments provide a first step in validating novel, conserved molecular mechanisms of GBM invasion for future therapeutic development. Invasive GBM is thought to be driven by CSCs, which can migrate and invade as single cells, finger-like collectives, or as a mixture of migration modes (Cheng et al. 2011; Volovetz et al. 2020). Human Rap1a, originally identified in a Drosophila screen of collective border cell migration, influences CSC-mediated GBM cell invasion (Aranjuez et al. 2012; Volovetz et al. 2020). Interestingly, knocking down Sym and α-Cat in the border cells caused the most severe migration and cluster cohesion defects. While the respective human orthologs SYMPK, CTNNA1, and CTNNA2 did not show regional tumor heterogeneity, they are each expressed in GBM tumors and/or are generally elevated in different grades of glioma including GBM (Grade IV; Supplementary Figure S2)., Regional expression of representative human ortholog adhesion-related genes in GBM patient tumors. (A) Expression of human orthologs of neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 3 (KIRREL3) is significantly enriched in the LE and IT compared to other tumor regions, including the CT, PNZ, PAN, HBV, and MP. (B) In contrast, expression of human orthologs symplekin (SYMPK) and catenin alpha 1 (CTNNA1) demonstrated little to no significant change when comparing different regions of tumor. Data from the Ivy GAP are shown as mean expression ± SD across GBM tumor regions. Statistics are shown in Supplementary Table S2: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, one way ANOVA with Tukey HSD., Regional expression of representative human ortholog adhesion-related genes in GBM patient tumors. (A) Expression of human orthologs of neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 3 (KIRREL3) is significantly enriched in the LE and IT compared to other tumor regions, including the CT, PNZ, PAN, HBV, and MP.

Data from the Ivy GAP are shown as mean expression ± SD across GBM tumor regions. Statistics are shown in Supplementary Table S2: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, one way ANOVA with Tukey HSD., A limitation of this study involves the use of GBM expression and survival data from TCGA. The samples used to curate this database are primarily taken from core biopsies of resected GBM tumors, which restricts the availability of invasive cells and therefore the use of these data for assessing invasive potential. Similarly, direct associations between expression and survival may be impacted by variable gene expression across different regions of the tumor. To counteract this, we used the Ivy GAP database to provide additional information about expression in each tumor region. Conversely, a large proportion of cells in the LE and IT of the Ivy atlas are nontumoral, which may confound interpretation of regional expression. It should also be noted, however, that expression alone is not necessarily indicative of function and that these studies are being used as a foundation upon which to build future studies., GBM, the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, is also one of the most lethal (Ostrom et al. 2014, 2018). These tumors are highly invasive and possess a self-renewing CSC population. CSCs are highly invasive and can migrate either individually or collectively (Cheng et al. 2011; Volovetz et al. 2020). Here, we used a human GBM-informed approach to identify conserved regulators of adhesion during collective cell migration and invasion, particularly focused on testing genes in the border cell model. We identified eight adhesion-related Drosophila genes (orthologs of 13 human genes) associated with glioma patient survival. Of the eight adhesion-related Drosophila genes found to be essential for collective cell migration, two human orthologs, NEGR1 and KIRREL3 showed significant regional enrichment in the LE and IT of human GBM tumors, areas associated with enhanced cell invasion. CTNNA2 was expressed in these invasive regions, though was also expressed at high levels in other regions of the tumor. Knockdown of these eight genes disrupted border cell migration to varying degrees, with two genes α-cat and Sym significantly disrupting both cohesion of the cluster and successful cell migration. Although the objective of this study was broadly directed toward understanding the adhesion-associated roles of genes in collective cell migration and invasion, many of these genes may have additional functions apart from cell adhesion. These eight Drosophila genes thus represent a starting point to further investigate the specific mechanisms by which these genes regulate normal collective cell migration. Future experiments using loss-of-function alleles and live imaging approaches are required to confirm the adhesion-related, or other, functions of these genes in the border cell system. In addition, whether these genes function through an adhesion-dependent or -independent manner in GBM tumors needs to be determined with follow-up experiments, using both mammalian and nonmammalian models of GBM, including Drosophila glioma models (Agnihotri et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018; Chen and Read 2019; Chi et al. 2019; Gangwani et al. 2020; Shahzad et al. 2021). Overall, the strategy used in this study has the potential to identify new genes and conserved mechanisms that drive collective cell migration of normal cells and those in invasive cancers such as GBM., Strains are available upon request.

These data serve as a resource to identify candidate regulators of the normal vs. diseased states in a genetically controlled in vivo context., Human melanoma is notable as one of the most highly mutagenized cancers, making comparisons between patient samples difficult given variation in potentially irrelevant passenger somatic mutations in addition to the background of an outbred heterogenous population (Hodis et al. 2012). Genetically engineered tumor models allow for comparisons of premalignant and cancer cells between highly related individuals (e.g., siblings, cousins) with defined driver and tumor suppressor mutations. A zebrafish model combining a BRAFV600E mutation, present in over 50% of human melanomas, with a loss of function (lf) in p53 develops one to three melanomas in its lifetime (Patton et al. 2005). Despite high genetic relatedness, the Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf tumors still display genomic heterogeneity but without clear functional consequences in this model (Yen et al. 2013). High heterogeneity in melanoma can lead to variable responses to currently available therapies (Reuben et al. 2017). To continue to identify novel melanoma therapies, we must delve deeper into the transcriptional and epigenetic differences that exist between the normal and diseased states., Many studies have utilized next-generation sequencing technologies to evaluate melanoma subtypes based on clinicopathological characteristics (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2015; Hayward et al. 2017; Tsoi et al. 2018; Rabbie et al. 2019; Cisarova et al. 2020; Durante et al. 2020), major mutations (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2015; Travnickova et al. 2019), and drug resistance and survival (Rambow et al. 2018; Garg et al. 2021). Prior studies comparing melanocytes and cutaneous melanoma cells have reported on coding mutations, gene expression changes only, or have used human or zebrafish cell lines rather than focusing on in vivo animal models (Yen et al. 2013; Haltaufderhyde and Oancea 2014; Kaufman et al. 2016; Badal et al. 2017; Kunz et al. 2018; Venkatesan et al. 2018; Marie et al. 2020; Wouters et al. 2020). Single-cell RNA-seq experiments so far generally focus on the heterogeneity within cell populations, rather than a comparison between melanocytes and melanoma cells, or they do not evaluate the epigenetic landscape (Ennen et al. 2015; Tirosh et al. 2016; Gan et al. 2018; Rambow et al. 2018; Baron et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Belote et al. 2021; Travnickova and Patton 2021). Thus, we sought to characterize the epigenetic and transcriptional differences between zebrafish nonmalignant, precancerous, and malignant melanocytes in a genetically defined melanoma context., Since its initial report in 2013, Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) has become a widely used method to provide a sensitive assessment of genomic accessibility (Buenrostro et al. 2013). The combination of epigenetic and transcriptional approaches has been used to decipher regulators in hematopoiesis and leukemia (Corces et al. 2016), find loci influencing pancreatic α- and β-cell differentiation (Ackermann et al. 2016), identify regions influencing gestational duration (Sakabe et al. 2020), characterize intermediate states in melanoma cell cultures (Wouters et al. 2020), among many other applications. Still, a comparison of the epigenetic and transcriptional profiles of sorted normal melanocytes to melanoma tumors in a native, in vivo biological context utilizing an animal model has been limited, thus diminishing our ability to dissect mechanisms governing melanoma initiation., Animal models represent a powerful tool to understand disease initiation and progression, discover therapeutic targets, and test drugs. Utilizing the Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf zebrafish model, we probed the natural biological context of normal melanocytes and related disease development, specifically that of melanoma cancer, using RNA- and ATAC-seq (Patton et al. 2005; White et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2016). Furthermore, we compared the transcriptional profiles of zebrafish melanocytes (MC) and melanoma cells (MA) to existing human RNA-seq datasets classifying subtypes of melanoma (Jönsson et al. 2010; Harbst et al. 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2015; Cirenajwis et al. 2015; Nsengimana et al. 2015; Lauss et al. 2016; Badal et al. 2017; Gan et al. 2018; Kunz et al. 2018) to further confirm the relevance of these animal models. We present a transcriptomic and genome-wide chromatin accessibility analysis of precancerous MC and fully transformed MA in the most widely used zebrafish melanoma model to be used as a resource for identifying pathways, genes, and loci which differentiate melanoma from normal pigment cells., Zebrafish were raised in the Washington University Zebrafish Consortium in accordance with animal protocols and the Washington University IACUC. Pair or harem crosses generated embryos, which were then raised at 28.5°C. The following wild type (WT), mutant, and transgenic strains were utilized: AB*, Tg(MiniCoopR; mitfa:mCherry), Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E); p53lf/lf; Tg(crestin:EGFP), Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E/+); p53+/lf; mitfa+/−; Tg(MiniCoopR; mitfa:mCherry), Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/mitfa+/−/Tg(MiniCoopR; mitfa:mCherry) and Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E); p53lf/lf; mitfa−/−., First, we injected WT AB* zebrafish with MiniCoopR:mitfa:mCherry. Fish with germline transmission of Tg(MiniCoopR; mitfa:mCherry) (source of MC_WT) were then crossed to Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E); p53lf/lf; mitfa−/− zebrafish and scored for presence of mCh+ melanocytes. These Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E/+); p53+/lf; mitfa+/−; mitfa:mCherry fish (source of MC_Het) were crossed to Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E); p53lf/lf; mitfa−/− zebrafish and scored for presence of mCh+ melanocytes, and PCR genotyped for BRAF and p53 status to confirm generation of Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/mitfa+/−/mitfa:mCherry zebrafish (source of MC_Homo)., For RNA-seq, we utilized mCh+ melanocytes sorted from the skin of three independent AB* zebrafish expressing MiniCoopR:mitfa:mCherry, three independent zebrafish heterozygous for Tg(BRAFV600E/+)/p53+/lf/mitfa+/−, and GFP+ melanoma tumor cells from five distinct tumors from three Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/Tg(crestin:EGFP) fish. The melanoma samples from MA3A, MA3B, and MA3C were isolated from one fish with three tumors: a tumor near the dorsal fin, a tumor on the tail, and a tumor on the head. For ATAC-seq, we utilized mCh+ melanocytes from three zebrafish heterozygous for Tg(BRAFV600E/+)/p53+/lf/mitfa+/− and one zebrafish with homozygous BRAF/p53 status [genotype Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/mitfa+/−], and GFP+ melanoma tumor cells from eight Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/Tg(crestin:EGFP) fish., Animals were euthanized using approved methods and bulk nodular tumors were excised using a razor blade. Skin samples were isolated by decapitating the euthanized zebrafish and peeling the skin off the muscle using two sets of forceps. Tumor or skin samples were manually sheared with a shortened pipette tip or using a homogenizer and then incubated in fresh 0.9× PBS with 12.5 µg/ml liberase for up to 30 min to dissociate cells. Fetal bovine serum terminated the reaction and the cells were passed through a 40 mm filter. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in 500 µl 0.9× PBS and kept on ice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed by the Washington University in St Louis core facility to isolate GFP+ tumor cells from sorted tumor samples or mCh+ melanocyte cells from sorted skin samples. Unpigmented and pigmented GFP+ and GFP− tumors were utilized to set the gating for GFP+ melanoma cells. Skin from mCh− AB* zebrafish was used to set the gating for isolating mCh+ melanocytes. Briefly, we gated first to exclude debris and doublets, then gated for the desired fluorescent marker based on comparison to a nonfluorescent sample., Images were acquired using a Nikon SMZ-18 with RiD2 color camera. For whole adult zebrafish images, multiple images were taken at 0.75× magnification and then merged in Adobe Lightroom 2020. Magnification of additional images for Supplementary Figure 1 specified in figure legend., RNA was isolated from cells using the Machery Nagel Nucleospin XS kit (Fischer Scientific cat No. NC0389511). Quantity and quality of RNA were assessed using a High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation. Sample preparation for sequencing was performed by the Genome Technology Access Center (GTAC). Briefly, cDNA was generated using a Clontech SMARTer cDNA amplification kit as per manufacturer’s recommendation. 1× 50 base pair single-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000., Demultiplexed fastq files were provided by the GTAC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA software (Mootha et al. 2003; Subramanian et al. 2005). Quality of sequenced reads was assessed by FastQC (Andrews 2010). Reads were aligned to GRCz11/danRer11 by STAR with the following parameters: –outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate –outFilterType BySJout –outSAMunmapped Within –outSAMattrIHstart 0 –outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonical –quantMode TranscriptomeSAM –outSAMstrandField intronMotif (Dobin et al. 2013). Transcriptome quantification was performed by RSEM using the danRer11 NCBI RefSeq gene annotations (Li and Dewey 2011). RNA-seq reads were normalized with DESeq2 (Anders and Huber 2010). Boxplots were made using ggplot2 (Wickham 2016), heatmaps with either ggplot2 or the pheatmap function (Kolde 2015), and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the plotPCA function in the DESeq2 package (Anders and Huber 2010)., Up to 50,000 cells per sample were tagmented with Nextera Tn5 transposase using the Illumina Nextera kit and purified with a Qiagen MinElute reaction kit per methods modified from Buenrostro et al. (2013). The DNA was then PCR amplified to add indexing primers in nine cycles. SPRI AMPure beads enriched for fragments under ∼600 bp. The library was then amplified again with the nine-cycle protocol, followed by cleanup with SPRI AMPure beads. The DNA library was quantified with a Qubit DNA High Sensitivity assay and analyzed for quality and size distribution on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation with a High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape. Samples were pooled at a 10 nM final concentration. Sequencing was run with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system with 2 × 50 bp read length by the Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine GTAC., Demultiplexed fastq files were provided by GTAC. Quality of fastq files was assessed by FASTQC (Andrews 2010). Adapter sequences were removed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011), and reads were aligned to GRCz11/danRer11 using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner using default parameters (Li and Durbin 2009). BAM files were sorted using samtools, and reads with Mapping Quality (MAPQ) scores <30 and improperly paired were removed using bamtools filters with the following commads: -mapQuality “>30” -isProperPair “true” (Li et al. 2009; Barnett et al. 2011). We used the MarkDuplicates command from the Genome Analysis Tool Kit to remove duplicates (McKenna et al. 2010). BAM files were converted to the BED format using bedtools bamtobed command (Quinlan and Hall 2010) and used as input for peak calling with MACS2 (Zhang et al. 2008). We used the callpeak command with the following parameters: –g 1e9, –nomodel, –extside 100, –shift –50, –keep-dup 999, –call-summits. Output bedGraph files were sorted, clipped, and converted to BigWig format using the bedGraphToBigWig command (Kent et al. 2010). Quality of peaks was assessed by ChIPQC (Carroll et al. 2014). The irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) was performed between replicates using the idr command (Li et al. 2011). Differentially accessible regions were called using DiffBind (Stark and Brown 2011). All motif analyses were performed using Homer (Heinz et al. 2010)., Three Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/mitfa+−/mitfa:mCherry zebrafish and three Tg(mitfa:BRAFV600E); p53lf/lf/crestin:EGFP) zebrafish were euthanized and each whole fish was placed in a 50 ml conical with 40 ml 10% formalin for fixation and shipped to HistoWiz for further preparation. Briefly, zebrafish were decalcified and embedded; then, five sagittal sections along the midline were stained with hematoxylin and eosin., To compare the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility states of normal (WT) and precancerous melanocytes (MC; harboring the BRAFV600E mutation and p53 lf mutation) to fully transformed melanoma (MA) cells, we generated a stable transgenic zebrafish line with fluorescently labeled melanocytes expressing mCherry driven by the melanocyte-specific melanocyte inducing transcription factor a (mitfa) promoter (Ceol et al. 2011; White et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2016). A stable MiniCoopr; mitfa:mCherry transgenic line was generated in WT AB* zebrafish using Tol2-mediated insertion (Figure 1, A and B) and then crossed to Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/mitfa−/− zebrafish (Ceol et al. 2011) to generate Tg(BRAFV600E/+)/p53+/lf/mitfa+/−/Tg(MiniCoopr; mitfa:mCherry) zebrafish to investigate the impact of overactivation of BRAF in melanocytes (Figure 1, A and C and Supplementary Figure S1). Zebrafish heterozygous at the key BRAF and p53 melanoma driver loci had thicker and darker melanocyte stripes, with minor melanocyte expansion into the interstripe as compared with WT AB* fish (Figure 1, B and C and Supplementary Figure S1), consistent with the melanocyte pattern seen with homozygous BRAFV600E shown previously (Patton et al. 2005). The presence of the mitfa minigene in the MiniCoopR backbone containing the mitfa:mCherry transgene did not appear to alter the normal striping pattern (whereas the presence of the BRAF and p53 alterations did, comparing Figure 1, B and C), and we detected upregulation of mitfa in the MA vs. both MC populations (Supplementary Table S1), consistent with prior expression studies (Kaufman et al. 2016)., Isolation of zebrafish melanocytes and melanoma cells for RNA- and ATAC-seq analysis.

MC, melanocyte sample; Het, heterozygous for BRAFV600E and p53 transgenes; WT, wild-type AB* fish; MA, melanoma sample., Using FACS, we carefully isolated mCherry-positive (mCh+) melanocytes from Tg(MiniCoopr; mitfa:mCherry) (MC_WT) and Tg(BRAFV600E/+)/p53+/lf/mitfa+/−/Tg(MiniCoopr; mitfa:mCherry) (MC_Het) zebrafish skin (Supplementary Figure S2, A, D, and E). We could visualize mCh+ melanocytes in both isolated scales and in the underlying hypodermis when overlying scales were removed (Supplementary Figure S2, C and D), and as we stripped the skin in its entirety after euthanasia, our melanocyte population likely includes both scale associated and hypodermal sources. mCh+ melanocyte cells were similarly ∼1–5% abundant during FACS from the skin of AB* or BRAFV600E/+/p53+/lf/mitfa+/− zebrafish (Supplementary Figure S2). We also performed FACS on previously described Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP)-positive (GFP+) melanoma tumors from Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/crestin:EGFP (MA) zebrafish to isolate melanoma cells (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S2, B, C, F, and H; Kaufman et al. 2016). As previously described, these melanoma tumors are identifiable as raised, highly cellular masses that are locally invasive (Supplementary Figure S2, G and H) and readily differentiated from normal skin regions, both grossly (Figure 1, B–D) and on histological sections (Supplementary Figure S2, G and H). Zebrafish crestin is expressed in embryonic neural crest (NC) and is re-expressed with emergence of melanoma (Kaufman et al. 2016). We then performed RNA- and ATAC-seq with each cell population (see Materials and methods; Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S2)., As expected, GFP+ melanoma tumor cells and mCh+ melanocyte samples clustered based on crestin, EGFP, and mCherry normalized read counts by Euclidean distance. GFP+ samples show high crestin expression supporting the fidelity of the crestin:EGFP transgene as a faithful reporter of endogenous crestin expression (Figure 1E). Although melanocytes had some reads aligning to crestin, crestin expression was 109 times higher in melanoma (39,232 average reads) than in melanocytes (359 average reads), consistent with previously reported massive upregulation of crestin in melanoma tumors (White et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2016; Figure 1E)., ATAC-seq and RNA-seq libraries from sorted cells passed established Encode QC metrics for library quality and read depth. Samples for RNA-seq were sequenced to an average of 29,103,353 reads, of which 9,897,358 (34%) aligned to the transcriptome (Figure 1F). Of all genes with at least 1 count per million (CPM) mapped reads, the majority (∼55%) had >10 CPM, suggesting adequate read depth. Similarly, ATAC-seq samples were sequenced to an average of 35,69,8542 paired reads of which 13,594,823 (38.1%) uniquely mapped to the genome (Figure 1G). The average fraction of uniquely mapped reads in peaks is 39.2% (Figure 1G)., Transcriptional profiles of GFP+ (melanoma) were highly correlated (Pearson R ≥ 0.85; Figure 2A), even from different fish. mCh+ (melanocytes) samples also had highly correlated transcriptional profiles (Figure 2A). Melanocytes from WT fish (MC_WT) and fish heterozygous for the BRAFV600E-driver oncogene and p53 lf allele (MC_Het) were also highly correlated with one another with small differences in correlation coefficients between origin genotype, which is notable given the presence of the activated BRAFV600E oncogene in the MC_Het melanocytes (R = 0.88–0.91 within WT fish, R = 0.85–0.87 within heterozygotes, and R = 0.85–0.87 across genotypes; Figure 2A). Melanoma samples were similarly highly correlated (R = 0.87–0.93) with slightly higher correlation for multiple tumors isolated from the same fish (R = 0.93 for MA3A, MA3B, MA3C, and R = 0.87–0.92 for external replicates). Melanocytes and melanoma cells readily separated using unsupervised hierarchical clustering (correlation coefficients between 0.74 and 0.81) indicating that transcriptional profiles alter during transformation from a BRAF mutant melanocyte to a fully oncogenic melanoma cell, but remain more closely correlated in a WT (MC_WT) or premalignant (MC_Het) state. Furthermore, PCA readily separates melanocytes from melanomas, with the first principal component accounting for 38% of the variance (Figure 2B). Principal component two (accounting for 11% of the variance) likely captures the lesser transcriptional differences between the WT and Het MC samples., RNA-seq analysis of melanocyte and melanoma cell populations.

MC, melanocyte sample; Het, heterozygous for BRAFV600E and p53 transgenes; WT, wild-type AB* fish; MA, melanoma sample., We identified 1144 genes significantly upregulated in melanomas vs. melanocytes, and 2984 genes significantly upregulated in melanocytes compared with melanoma cells [log2 fold change (log2FC) > 1 and adjusted P-value < 10−6, Supplementary Figure S3A]. Surprisingly, the number of melanoma-upregulated genes meeting increasing log fold change cutoffs dropped off more steeply than melanocyte-upregulated genes, indicating that more genes are downregulated in melanoma as compared with melanocytes (Supplementary Figure S3B)., Comparing WT and Het (Tg(BRAFV600E/+)/p53+/−) melanocytes, there are far fewer significantly differentially expressed genes with 12 genes upregulated in WT over Het melanocytes and 41 genes upregulated in Het over WT melanocytes with log2FC > 1 and adjusted P-value ≤ 10−6 (Supplementary Figure S3C). These results highlight the surprising similarity within melanocytes and premalignant (i.e., BRAF mutant/p53 mutant) melanocytes as compared with the more dramatic changes that occur when compared with transformed melanocytes/melanoma. To facilitate further inquiry, we provide a list of all gene expression changes and P-values between melanocytes, premalignant melanocytes, and melanoma cells (Supplementary Table S1)., We compared gene expression profiles between our melanocyte and melanoma samples to the four gene lists from Jönsson et al. (2010) stratifying human cutaneous melanoma into proliferative, pigmentation, high immune, and normal-like subtypes. First, we assessed which subtype of human melanoma our zebrafish melanoma samples most resembled and found the highest average expression of genes associated with the pigmentation subtype (Figure 2C). This was further confirmed with GSEA detecting significant enrichment of genes associated with the human melanoma pigmentation subtype (GSEA ES = 0.4299, P = 0.036; Figure 2D). Finally, comparing expression in zebrafish melanocytes to melanoma cells, genes in the pigmentation list had the most significant upregulation in melanoma cells (paired P-value = 0.007; Supplementary Figure S3, D–H)., Previous studies have shown that melanoma reactivates aspects of an embryonic NC program, with prominent NC genes such as sox10 the subject of much interest (Shakhova et al. 2012; Cronin et al. 2013; Mohamed et al. 2013; Kaufman et al. 2016). The central gene regulatory network, or “wiring diagram,” for NC development has been well-described, and we used the NC gene regulatory network described by Kunz et al. (2018) to examine gene expression changes in each condition for NC pathway genes (Supplementary Table S3). We found sox10 and dlx2a are upregulated in melanoma in agreement with previous smaller scale transcriptional analyses (black boxes, Figure 2E; Kaufman et al. 2016). Interestingly, important melanocyte-specific genes including mitfa, tyrp1b, kita, dct, tyr, and tyrp1a were upregulated in the melanoma samples, supporting that melanoma cells sustain a continued presence of an active melanocyte identity (red boxes, Figure 2E). To further probe this finding, we assessed whether either cell population had enrichment of human melanocyte genes (Reemann et al. 2014). Indeed, both zebrafish melanocytes and melanoma cells had high expression of human melanocyte genes (Supplementary Figure S3H)., Another recurring and important question relates to the idea that the NC incorporates a spectrum of developmental time (e.g., from specification, to delamination, to migration, etc.), spatial differences (e.g., cranial, thoracic, caudal NC), and descendant lineages (e.g., glia, melanocyte, chondrocyte), each with defining genetic markers in its transcriptional program (Supplementary Table S3; Simões-Costa and Bronner 2015; Williams et al. 2019). We reviewed our melanoma differential gene sets in relation to these NC subsets and, aside from a “strengthening” of the melanocyte program as noted above and decrease in expression of glial (mbpa/b) and chondrocyte (sox9b) factors, we did not note other clear unifying NC subsets that aligned more closely to the melanoma program (Figure 2E). Given the widespread dysregulation of gene expression in the cancerous melanoma state, this is perhaps unsurprising that the malignant phenotype would entail a broad and not entirely faithful amalgamation of melanocyte and NC transcriptional identities., To characterize the genome-wide chromatin accessibility of premalignant Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf mutant melanocytes and melanoma, we isolated premalignant melanocytes (mCh+) from four zebrafish, including three MC_Het and one sample from a Tg(BRAFV600E)/p53lf/lf/Tg(MiniCoopR; mitfa:mCherry) zebrafish (MC_Homo). Since MC_WT and MC_Het read counts were highly correlated in the RNA-seq, we utilized MC_Het zebrafish for ATAC-seq analysis. We compared these profiles to those from eight melanoma tumors sorted for crestin:EGFP expression (Figure 3A)., ATAC-seq analysis of melanocyte and melanoma cells.

MC, melanocyte sample; Het, heterozygous for BRAFV600E and p53 transgenes; Homo, homozygous for BRAFV600E and p53 transgenes; MA, melanoma sample., As in the RNA-seq analysis, melanocyte samples and melanoma samples clustered according to normal vs. malignant state (Figure 3, A and B). To assess the reproducibility of each identified accessible site within a condition, we evaluated the IDR, setting a threshold of 0.05. For MC samples, an average of 53% of sites passed IDR 0.05, and for the MA samples, the average was 33% (Supplementary Figure S4A)., In our ATAC-Seq analysis, 56,936 sites demonstrated differential accessibility (P < 0.05, IDR < 0.05) between melanocyte and melanoma cells. Open regions, or peaks, within 3 kilobases (kb) of transcriptional start sites (TSS) were centered at the TSS (Supplementary Figure S4B). Of promoter annotated peaks, 85% of differentially accessible sites were more open in melanoma as compared with melanocytes (Supplementary Figure S4C and Table S4)., We examined the differentially accessible chromatin regions using HOMER de novo analysis to identify over-represented DNA motifs representing putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites (Figure 3D). In order of significance, sites associated with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) topped the list—a TF commonly mutated in cancer and known to normally function widely in controlling chromatin architecture (Kim et al. 2015). TF binding motif families corresponding to key NC-associated factors also rounded out the top 10 list, including the Forkhead, SOXE, and ETS families. Melanocyte and NC programs are particularly active in melanoma cells, with increased sox10 and mitfa expression, respectively, seen in the RNA-seq data (Figure 2E), and this appears consistent with enrichment of SOX9/10 (SOXE family) and MITF (E/M-boxes) binding sites in more accessible regions in melanoma (Figure 3C). Finally, we noted the overall similarity in the contour of chromatin accessibility within premalignant melanocytes and melanomas as well as the numerous areas of differential accessibility as, for example, near sox10 and mitfa (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S4D)., To examine potential relationships between open chromatin and gene expression, we assessed the relationship between log2FC for differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible promoter peaks. As expected, the majority of genes with greater e",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pression in melanoma had more accessibility with peaks within 3 kb of the promoter (n = 2386 pairs of genes and peaks; one gene can be linked to multiple ATAC-seq peaks), while genes with less expression were less accessible at the promoter (n = 499). Interestingly, 1213 genes had greater accessibility at the promoter in melanoma, yet had lower expression. We then focused on evaluating the relationship between accessibility and expression in NC genes using a “long list” of 329 genes associated with NC from ZFIN.org and a curated shortlist of 44 genes associated with specific NC developmental stages (Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). Utilizing the long list, we found a modest correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient R = 0.3951) between gene expression accessibility at promoter-proximal peaks within 3 kb of the promoter (Figure 4B). This relationship was strengthened when focusing only on peaks at the TSS (Figure 4C;R = 0.6067). Further, focusing specifically on genes previously shown to be involved in NC development, this association was even more pronounced (Figure 4D; R = 0.6686), with peaks at the promoter showing a clear correlation with expression (Figure 4E;R = 0.8488)., Integration of gene expression and accessibility.

Significance color scheme same as in (B, C)., Here, we present a zebrafish model allowing for efficient isolation of melanocytes and melanoma cells and provide a resource capturing transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes occurring in vivo during de novo tumor development. Independent replicates from genetically related animals add robustness to the dataset while limiting the background genetic complexity of a fully outbred population. This combined RNA- and ATAC-seq analysis of normal, premalignant, and transformed melanocytes/melanoma offers a tool for gene and pathway discovery in melanoma biology. Moreover, the tumor diversity with pigmentation status and tumor location (Supplementary Table S2) provides a comprehensive picture of cutaneous melanoma in a BRAF-driven, MITF-high model (Travnickova et al. 2019). Based on widely used QC metrics, we conclude that our RNA- and ATAC-seq data accurately reflect the in vivo transcriptional and chromatin accessibility state of the average premalignant BRAF/p53 mutant melanocyte and melanoma cell and provide an important and broadly useful tool for further investigating transcriptional and epigenetic programs underlying these related but crucially different pre- and fully malignant states. Similar studies have shed light on the epigenetic regulation of dysregulated genes that promote melanoma, such as sox10 (Cunningham et al. 2021), or have been used to delineate developmental programs underlying erythroid differentiation (Ludwig et al. 2019). Studies have found a reactivation of an NC program in melanoma (Kaufman et al. 2016), and indeed we observed upregulation of NC genes such as crestin, sox10, tfap2a, dlx2a, among others. However, when we expanded the analysis to include NC genes segregated by stage of expression in NC, there was not a clear program upregulated in melanoma (i.e., not all migratory NC markers were upregulated). This further supports a widespread dysregulation of expression programs in the disease state and begs the question of which consistent gene program is reactivated in melanoma. Nevertheless, there is an apparent relationship between accessibility at the TSS and gene expression of NC-associated genes (Figure 4E)., Interestingly, our dataset shows that in melanoma there are more genes with significant downregulation in melanoma relative to melanocytes, despite the presence of more accessible regions in the melanoma genome, supporting previous findings that points of control other than promoter accessibility, such as TF and chromatin regulatory protein abundances and activities, may be primary influencers of gene expression and thus changes in cell identity in the transition to a malignant state (Travnickova et al. 2019; Santoriello et al. 2020; Baggiolini et al. 2021; Fazio et al. 2021; Terranova et al. 2021). Indeed, it has been shown that very distal enhancers can control gene expression, indicating that open regions of chromatin may not necessarily regulate the most proximal gene (Lettice et al. 2003; Amano et al. 2009; Lacomme et al. 2018). Most changes in accessibility occur in distal nonpromoter regions (Supplementary Figure S4C; Thurman et al. 2012; Pliner et al. 2018; Friman et al. 2019), and deciphering the relationship between gene expression and cis-regulatory regions has been a topic of immense focus (Ackermann et al. 2016; Gonen et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2020; Cunningham et al. 2021; Panigrahi and O’Malley 2021). Our study serves as a foundation to probe open chromatin regions and potential regulatory functions., Furthermore, though all samples had an active melanocyte-specific program, genes typically associated with melanocytes were upregulated and more accessible in melanoma, consistent with a widespread dysregulation in additional gene programs in the melanoma cell state. We anticipate these data will contribute to ongoing functional analyses testing candidates that control the crucial epigenetic and transcriptional differences driving the transition between the normal and diseased cell state., Strains are available upon request.

Together with the development of statistics for hypothesis testing, e.g., f-statistics (Patterson et al. 2012), these large datasets have allowed us to characterize the genetic structure and demographic history of diverse populations with unprecedented resolution. Genomic population history studies often rely on comparing data from the population(s) of interest with reference variation datasets from other ancient and contemporary populations. This comparison is usually performed by applying methods such as principal components analysis (Patterson et al. 2006), multidimensional scaling (Malaspinas et al. 2014), model-based clustering (Alexander et al. 2009), and hypothesis testing through f-statistics (Patterson et al. 2012). The latter have been particularly useful as they can be used both for exploratory analyses, e.g., measuring shared drift between pairs of populations, and for formal hypothesis testing, e.g., testing for admixture and estimating admixture proportions. Importantly, f-statistics can be computed from pseudo-haploid calls from ancient DNA (aDNA) data where calling diploid genotypes is challenging due to low-depth and increased error (but see Günther and Nettelblad 2019). This strategy is not confined to human evolution research, but it has been successfully applied to other study organisms, e.g., maize (Ramos-Madrigal et al. 2016), horses (Gaunitz et al. 2018), and canids (Ramos-Madrigal et al. 2021)., Over the last few years, ancient and present-day population genomic sequencing has become accessible to more research groups worldwide. However, many data analysis tools remain accessible only to users with more experience in computer programming, thus creating a disconnect between researchers in charge of data generation, researchers with data analysis expertise, and researchers from diverse disciplines involved in results interpretation. Whereas this might be unavoidable in some cases, simplifying routine exploratory data analyses into user-friendly tools could facilitate the contribution of researchers with less computational experience to genomic data analysis and interpretation. We introduce FrAnTK, a fast, user-friendly toolkit that allows users to easily combine their sequencing data with reference datasets and compute and visualize allele frequency-based statistics routinely used in population genomic studies. FrAnTK is mainly aimed at users with limited programming experience, but we anticipate it will also be helpful to experienced users who seek to streamline exploratory analyses and visualization., FrAnTK contains tools with four main functionalities summarized in Figure 1: (1) precomputing the population allele frequencies from a SNP variation dataset, (2) computing allele frequency-based statistics, (3) visualizing multiple related statistics, and (4) merging sequencing data with a reference SNP variation dataset. We provide a description of the main tools included in FrAnTK in Supplementary Table S1., Overview of the main FrAnTK functionalities, their input and output files. Input files are shown in blue, operations performed by FrAnTK are shown in red and output files are shown in purple. *See Supplementary Table S1 and github.com/morenomayar/FrAnTK#SecComputingA SingleStatistic for a full list of the analyses implemented in FrAnTK., Overview of the main FrAnTK functionalities, their input and output files. Input files are shown in blue, operations performed by FrAnTK are shown in red and output files are shown in purple. *See Supplementary Table S1 and github.com/morenomayar/FrAnTK#SecComputingA SingleStatistic for a full list of the analyses implemented in FrAnTK., We start with a plink file (Chang et al. 2015) containing genome-wide bi-allelic SNP data from multiple individuals from different populations. In this case, we rely on plink files as they have been widely used by researchers in the field for over a decade (see the practical example included below for a note on how to go from vcf to plink). To speed up the subsequent computation of test statistics and to substantially reduce computational resource requirements (see benchmark below), we first compute the allele frequencies for each SNP site for each population. We store these frequencies in a .gz compressed file, accompanied by three more files that keep track of SNP site coordinates and population names and ploidy (see file format description in Supplementary Information)., We supply a set of scripts for computing allele frequency-based statistics (Supplementary Table S1). These scripts take the precomputed allele frequencies as input and return a point estimate together with its standard error, estimated through a weighted block-jackknife procedure (Patterson et al. 2012). In this release, we provide scripts for computing average pairwise distances, f3, f4, and D-statistics, f4-ratios (Patterson et al. 2012), admixture/contamination-corrected f4-statistics (Reich et al. 2012), minor allele count-stratified D-statistics (Prüfer et al. 2014), and enhanced D-statistics that rely on specific ascertainment schemes to detect faint allele sharing patterns (Meyer et al. 2012). All analyses can be restricted to transversion polymorphisms to reduce the effect of aDNA postmortem damage (Briggs et al. 2007). These scripts can be run in parallel as they keep memory usage to a minimum by processing one SNP at a time. Moreover, they can be easily modified to accommodate additional analyses. We note that an implementation of some of these analyses, e.g., admixture/contamination-corrected f4-statistics (Reich et al. 2012), enhanced D-statistics (Meyer et al. 2012), has not been made available elsewhere or depend on additional data manipulation, which hinders their widespread usage., To supplement the scripts for computing single statistics, we provide multi-threaded wrappers for automated computation of multiple related statistics (Supplementary Table S1). A common exploratory analysis is to assess the genetic relationship between a fixed test population and a set of reference populations. For instance, we can compute all possible f3-statistics of the form f3(TestPop, X; Outgroup), to explore what is the population X in the reference dataset that shares the most drift with the test population. Our wrapper scripts make it possible to run this kind of analysis with a single command and support average pairwise distances, f3, f4, “basic” D and enhanced D-statistics. In addition, we include wrapper scripts for computing admixture/contamination-corrected f4-statistics over a range of admixture/contamination proportions and minor allele count-stratified D-statistics over a specified range of minor allele counts., The wrapper scripts also provide automated plotting functionality, which allows users to create visual representations of classical exploratory analyses (e.g., Figure 2, A–C). For every run, we automatically produce a plot with default plotting parameters. The user can easily customize this plot by providing simple files that map populations to categories with specific plotting parameters (see usage example below)., Visual representation of the worldwide allele sharing patterns of the ∼24ka Mal'ta individual produced by FrAnTK. (A) Shared genetic drift between the Mal'ta individual and present-day populations in the HGDP dataset. We show the autof3wfixed.R wrapper results for f3(Mal'ta, X; Yoruba). Error bars represent 1.96 standard errors. (B) D-statistics exploring non-East Asian admixture in the Karitiana (an Indigenous American population). We show the autoDwfixed.R wrapper results for D(Karitiana, Han; X, Yoruba). Error bars represent 3.3 standard errors. |Z|-scores are shown next to each point. (C) Mal'ta-related admixture-corrected f4-statistics of the form f4(Han, Karitiana; French, Yoruba). For each statistic, we subtracted f4(Han, Mal'ta; French, Yoruba) weighted by an admixture proportion c ranging between 0% and 50% (y-axis) using the autof4subtr.R wrapper. Error bars represent 3.3 standard errors. (D,E) TreeMix admixture graphs (as output by the TreeMix software) relating the ancient Mal'ta individual and a set of worldwide present-day populations. We fit admixture graphs with zero and one admixture edges., Visual representation of the worldwide allele sharing patterns of the ∼24ka Mal'ta individual produced by FrAnTK.

We fit admixture graphs with zero and one admixture edges., FrAnTK includes a single-command tool for merging sequencing data in BAM/CRAM format (Li et al. 2009) with the precomputed allele frequency files. For a given BAM/CRAM file, we sample one random allele at every SNP position included in the reference dataset to generate pseudo-haploid calls (calls giving rise to tri-allelic sites are set to missing). Reads and bases can be filtered according to their mapping and base quality. Additionally, the user can request a given number of bases to be ignored from both ends of each read to reduce aDNA postmortem damage-related error (Briggs et al. 2007). This merging approach is intended for cases where the user has access to low-to-intermediate-depth genome-wide sequencing data from a small sample of individuals, where reliable diploid genotype calling is not feasible, e.g., aDNA data (Nielsen et al. 2011; Günther and Nettelblad 2019). Thus, we restrict the analyses to known segregating sites present in the reference variation dataset (precomputed allele frequencies). For cases where sequencing data are available for a large enough sample, such that joint SNP calling is feasible using tools such as ANGSD (Korneliussen et al. 2014), the user can use the tools in FrAnTK to create pseudo-haploid calls on the previously identified segregating sites, without recurring to genotype reference data., FrAnTK is designed to be accessible, from installation to advanced usage, to researchers with less computational experience and to be applicable to a diverse range of projects. The tools in FrAnTK are implemented in python (python2 and python3 are supported), R and perl and depend only on standard tools and libraries that are commonly present in Unix-like setups in the field of population genomics: plink (Chang et al. 2015), samtools (Li et al. 2009) and the doParallel and ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) R libraries. Moreover, FrAnTK can be used on any genome-wide dataset from any study organism with a genome assembly contiguousness that allows for proper block-jackknife sampling., To assess the performance of our toolkit, we computed a number of statistics on a whole-genome reference dataset using FrAnTK and admixtools (Patterson et al. 2012), and recorded the running time and memory usage in each case. Although multiple tools for computing f- and other site-statistics are available, e.g., popstats (Skoglund et al. 2015), we use admixtools for benchmarking as it is the most commonly used peer-reviewed tool in the field. Moreover, admixtools is also called internally by the popular admixr wrapper (Petr et al. 2019). We used the SGDP Team C dataset (Mallick et al. 2016), which contains diploid genotypes for 33,512,001 bi-allelic SNPS from 345 individuals from 164 populations. We computed the 161 possible D-statistics of the form D(French, Sardinian; X, Ju-hoan_North), which we distributed over 20 threads (Intel Xeon Gold 2.10 GHz CPU). Using the qpDstat (v712) program from admixtools, the task was completed in 5.1 h, with a peak memory usage of ∼520 GB (∼26 GB per thread). Using the automated D-statistic wrapper in FrAnTK (autoDwfixed.R), the task was completed in 2.2 h, with a peak memory usage of ∼5.8 GB (∼287 MB per thread). We attribute these gains to two key features: (1) precomputing the allele frequencies to speed up subsequent computation and (2) processing one site at a time instead of loading the whole dataset onto memory. In this example, the admixtools-based approach would require the user to prepare a set of input files and distribute the parallel processes across different threads. Once all processes have run, the user would have to parse separate results and use a custom script for visualizing the results. By contrast, by using FrAnTK, the user can go from the initial data to a visual representation of the results by running two one-line commands., We present a practical example on how to use some of the different tools included in FrAnTK to explore the genetic ancestry of an ancient human whose genome has been sequenced to an average depth of coverage of 0.1X. We run the example on a compute node with 40 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 2.10 GHz CPU). We use the HGDP SNP array dataset (Li et al. 2008) as a reference and a subset of the 1X genome from an individual that lived ∼24 ka in the Central South Siberian site of Mal'ta (Raghavan et al. 2014). The data for running this example can be downloaded using wget., wget https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/E48FQXKjCe \, -O FrAnTKPrcaticalExampleData.tar.gz, The HGDP SNP array dataset contains diploid genotypes for 644,088 bi-allelic SNPS from 938 individuals from 53 worldwide populations. We start by precomputing the population allele frequencies of the HGDP reference dataset. This procedure was completed in 2.3 min., #get the number of populations in the _clust filen=`cut -f 3 HGDP_hg19_genotypes_clust | sort | uniq | wc -l`,  , #precompute population allele frequencies, frantk BuildFreqs plinkpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes \, clustfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_clust npops=""$n"" \, prefout=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f, In case the reference data were provided in a vcf file instead of a plink file, we can obtain a suitable plink file with bi-allelic SNPs using plink:, plink --vcf VCFFILENAME --double-id --snps-only \ --set-all-var-ids @:# --maf 0.000001 --make-bed \ --out PLINKFILENAME, Next, we combine the sequencing data from the 0.1X Mal'ta genome with the precomputed allele frequencies. To do so, we create a text file to specify that we will filter out all reads with a mapping quality <30, all nucleotides with a base quality <20 and we will trim 5 bases from each of the ends of every read., echo -e 'MalTa_subsample.bam\tMalTa\tMalTa\t30\t20\t5'> bamlist.txt, We then run addBams.py. This procedure was completed in <1 min. Note that one could alternatively run bam2plink.py to obtain a plink file with pseudo-haploid calls from the BAM file., frantk addBams listname=bamlist.txt \ freqpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f \, newpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f_WithBam nthr = 1, Using the merged data, we can explore the broad genetic affinities of the low-depth Mal'ta genome. We use the autof3wfixed.R wrapper (with 40 threads) to compute the 51 possible f3-statistics of the form f3(Mal'ta, X; Yoruba), where X represents all the populations in the HGDP SNP array dataset. This run was completed in ∼20 s., frantk autof3wfixed \ freqpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f_WithBam h1 = MalTa \, target=Yoruba catfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_cat \, legfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_leg nthr = 40, autof3wfixed.R will output the plot shown in Figure 2A. Note that color and symbol information is stored in the HGDP_hg19_genotypes_cat and HGDP_hg19_genotypes_leg files, which we supply through the catfile and legfile options. These results replicate the finding in (Raghavan et al. 2014), that the population represented by the ∼24 ka Mal'ta individual was genetically most closely related to present-day Indigenous Americans, followed by present-day West Eurasians., Raghavan et al. (2014) showed that the ancestors of Indigenous Americans most likely descended from an admixture event between an East Asian-related population and a Mal'ta-related population. We can test whether the Mal'ta individual is a better proxy for the ancient North Eurasian population that contributed to the ancestry of Indigenous Americans than present-day West Eurasians are. We run the autoDwfixed.R wrapper (with 40 threads) to compute all possible D-statistics of the form D(Karitiana, Han; X, Yoruba), where X represents all the populations in the HGDP dataset, including the Mal'ta individual. This run was completed in ∼20 s., frantk autoDwfixed \ freqpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f_WithBam \ h1=Karitiana \, h2=Han h4=Yoruba \ catfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_cat \, legfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_leg nthr=40, autoDwfixed.R will output the plot shown in Figure 2B. These results support that the ancient population that mixed with an East Asian-related population to give rise to the ancestors of Indigenous Americans was more closely related to the ancient Mal'ta individual than to present-day populations around the world., frantk autof4subtr \ freqpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f_WithBam \ h1=Han \, h2=Karitiana h3=French h4=Yoruba x=MalTa \ minp=0 maxp=.5pstep=0.025 \ catfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_cat \, legfile=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_leg nthr=40, Figure 2C shows that subtracting c ≥ 0.375 Mal'ta-related admixture results in f4-statistics with |Z|<3. These results are consistent with the previous estimate of 14–38% Mal'ta-related admixture in Indigenous Americans (Raghavan et al. 2014)., We can use the Freqs2Treemix.py script to convert the allele frequency file to the treemix input format (Pickrell and Pritchard 2012). First, we create a file with a list of populations of interest (one per line). Note that all populations should be present in the _pop file. Then we run Freqs2Treemix.py, which will output two sets of treemix files, one with all sites and one with transversions polymorphisms only (useful for aDNA). This procedure was completed in ∼30 s., echo ""San, MbutiPygmy, Yoruba, Mandenka, Papuan, Melanesian, Han, Dai, French, Italian, Sardinian, Orcadian, MalTa, Karitiana, Surui"" > poi , frantk Freqs2Treemix \ freqpref=HGDP_hg19_genotypes_f_WithBam \, tmpref=hgdp_malta_tm popsofint=poi, Finally, we run treemix following the parameters in Raghavan et al.

We reduce memory and computing times by precomputing allele frequencies, thus allowing researchers to explore their own datasets with reduced computational resource requirements. Notably, the automated wrappers and plotting functionality in FrAnTK allow the user to carry out complex exploratory analyses and produce publication-ready visual representations with single-line commands and minimal data manipulation. Thus, we consider an appropriate protocol would comprise an initial exploration using the tools in FrAnTK, followed by the application of model-based strategies such as those implemented in qpWave and qpGraph (Reich et al. 2012)., FrAnTK and its documentation are freely available in github.com/morenomayar/FrAnTK., Supplementary material is available at G3 online., The authors would like to thank Hugh McColl, Jazmín Ramos-Madrigal, Sofía Vieyra, and Eske Willerslev for their helpful feedback.

The PHG showed improved imputation accuracy, compared to a standard imputation tool Beagle, especially in predicting rare alleles., The past decade has seen an abundance of genomic sequence data produced for research and application in agricultural crops. With these new technologies, comes a question on how to effectively implement them (Torkamaneh et al. 2018). Two of the most common uses of genome-wide sequence data are genomic selection (GS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While most GWAS attempt to locate distinct, causative regions of the genome, GS incorporates all available markers to predict plant traits (Meuwissen et al. 2001). GS leverages a training set population that has both genotypic and phenotypic data to predict traits in a related germplasm with only genotypic data (Heffner et al. 2009). This allows breeders to both increase accuracy in selecting traits with low heritability and accelerate the rate of selections by decreasing selection cycle time (Xu et al. 2020)., While sequencing data have become increasingly common in agricultural applications, the financial cost remains a challenge to widespread implementation. Reduced representation marker systems have been produced to limit costs of performing genomic analyses (Romay 2018), all of which vary in marker density and depth, cost, and genotype confidence. In scenarios with limited diversity, such as single breeding pools or postbottleneck populations, individuals share large stretches of sequence. The strong association between alleles in these blocks, or their linkage disequilibrium (LD), determines the number and distribution of genotype markers needed to explain the genetic variation in the population. High density of markers becomes more important when performing analyses in populations where LD decays quickly as in species with high diversity or among unrelated individuals. High marker density can also be beneficial to incorporate knowledge on previously studied loci across the genome., To affordably obtain high-density genotypes or to bridge information between different marker platforms it becomes necessary to impute missing genotypes from available genotype data. Increasing the stability across genotyping platforms and reducing per-sample costs, becomes even more relevant in plant breeding scenarios, where many thousands of offspring are evaluated and changes in marker platform are common. Computational techniques to impute genome-wide information have been produced to bridge genotypic information from different marker panels and augment genotypic information from limited inputs (Yun et al. 2009). Genomic imputation methods often rely on a related training set with high confidence genotypic information to then predict missing genotypes. These methods have been shown to improve consistency and efficiency of analyses of both genome-wide associations (Spencer et al. 2009) and GS (Cleveland et al. 2011)., Imputation is very common in genomic studies but is still plagued with barriers to high accuracy in many species. Known limitations of imputation stem from LD, allele frequencies, and population structure of the training population (Alipour et al. 2019). These difficulties are further compounded when working with a highly heterozygous crop, where both copies of the genome need to be modeled (Fragoso et al. 2016; Nazzicari et al. 2016). Heterozygosity introduces the challenge of phasing, the process assigning alleles to haplotypes, a challenge that is not limited to plants (Friedenberg and Meurs 2016). Imputation accuracy has been shown to affect the accuracy of genomic prediction in multiple scenarios (Pimentel et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016; Van Den Berg et al. 2017). In addition, when tracking causative variation through the genome, high accuracy in imputation is necessary to evaluate variation across the entire genome. Highly accurate imputation methods are needed to increase the gains made by GS by making genotyping cheaper, more accurate, and more consistent., It has been shown that rare variants contribute to the genetic load and overall performance of crops (Yang et al. 2017; Kremling et al. 2018; Kono et al. 2019), making high imputation accuracy, especially for alleles at low frequency, desirable for plant genomics applications. Diverse imputation tools exist and are often designed for different scenarios. One of the more common tools Beagle (Browning et al. 2018), which was designed for application in humans, works by leveraging LD between variants to predict missing genotypes. Beagle uses LD clustering to create an acyclic graph and a Hidden Markov model (HMM) to infer the most likely haplotype. Another method EAGLE leverages stretches of identity by descent (IBD) to perform long-range phasing (Loh et al. 2016). In humans, where these imputation algorithms have been showcased, they have the advantage of large datasets with data from several thousands of individuals (Loh et al. 2016; Browning et al. 2018), while this is not often possible in many plant breeding scenarios., In maize, it’s been shown that Beagle has difficulty accurately imputing rare variants, while a haplotype library-based method such as FILLIN can do so more easily (Swarts et al. 2014). A recently developed method known as the practical haplotype graph (PHG) was created to leverage known haplotypes in a graph structure to efficiently impute genotypes. The PHG simplifies the genome to a set of distinct regions of the genome, for which it defines haplotypes. These haplotypes are constructed from whole-genome sequence data or genome assemblies and are used to construct a trellis graph, capturing the diversity of haplotypes at each range and the relationships between adjacent haplotype regions. Sequence reads are then aligned to the graph and an HMM is applied to predict the most likely haplotypes. By aligning reads to pan-genome haplotypes, the PHG minimizes errors due to reference bias, poor alignment, and miscalled variants. Utilizing a PHG methodology in plant and animal applications can improve the quality and quantity of genotype data for use in breeding and mapping scenarios., Here, we showcase the potential application of the PHG in imputation of heterozygous crops. The PHG has already been shown to be an efficient tool for aiding imputation and GS in breeding of the inbred cereal crop Sorghum (Jensen et al. 2020). It has also been implemented to impute genotypes in highly diverse maize lines (Franco et al. 2020). To show the utility of the PHG in a heterozygous crop we must overcome two distinct challenges: obtaining phased haplotypes to populate the database and modeling both copies of the genome accurately. Without an abundance of data, it is very difficult to obtain accurate phasing in a highly heterozygous species. This study will explore these challenges by imputing haplotypes from low-coverage skim sequencing, while comparing results to Beagle’s performance., To investigate the construction and performance of the PHG in a heterozygous scenario, we created a PHG for cassava (Manihot esculenta), a root crop with high levels of heterozygosity reinforced by centuries of clonal propagation. In this study, we utilize sequence data from the previously published HapMapII in cassava (Ramu et al. 2017), which includes WGS data for 241 cassava clones. These data are used to produce a PHG in cassava and showcase its effectiveness in genomic imputation in a heterozygous crop. We further validate these methods through genomic prediction and simulation., Genomic data were used from the second-generation Cassava Haplotype map consisting of 241 taxa, including both cultivated and wild germplasm (Ramu et al. 2017). Raw data are composed of short-read, whole-genome sequence data from each taxon amounting to greater than 20× coverage on average. The high depth of the sequence data is necessary to accurately distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous variants. We used the cassava v6 reference genome assembly in this study, which contains 18 chromosome level scaffolds summing to ∼500 Mbp of the estimated genome size of 700 Mbp. Haplotype regions, termed here as reference ranges, were defined by genic regions with additional 1000 bp flanking sequence resulting in ∼32,000 reference ranges after merging overlapping ranges, with an average size of 4 kbp., The detailed process of creating a PHG is outlined at “https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/practicalhaplotypegraph/wiki/Home” and has been described previously (Jensen et al. 2020; Valdes Franco 2020). Here, we outline the specific steps taken to create a PHG in the heterozygous crop cassava (Figure 1). The major hurdle to producing a haplotype graph in a heterozygous species is obtaining accurately phased haplotypes. Because many of these cassava lines are cultivated taxa, we expected to find IBD haplotypes brought about by generations of breeding within restricted breeding pools. These IBD segments provide confidently phased haplotypes as well as capturing their relationships to adjacent haplotypes (Figure 2). We identified and sampled these homozygous haplotypes which we inferred to represent IBD haplotypes. This was done by measuring the number of heterozygous variants for each reference range in each taxon, then classifying those haplotypes as homozygous or not. The threshold for haplotypes to be considered IBD was determined empirically to be 0.001 heterozygous SNPs per base pair (Supplementary Figure S1), as de novo mutations or errors in variant calling may produce low levels of perceived heterozygosity. This threshold was additionally validated by testing imputation accuracy of the PHG., Imputation Methodology Flowchart.

(Top) Representation of reference ranges informed from genic regions from the reference genome.

(Top) Representation of reference ranges informed from genic regions from the reference genome. (Bottom) haplotypes sampled from runs of homozygosity for use in PHG with different colors representing separate haplotypes at a given region (i.e., ranges 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are homozygous and haplotypes can be sampled)., After haplotypes were sampled from IBD regions of the genome, they were loaded as GVCF files into a PHG database. Similar haplotypes were then collapsed based on sequence similarity to produce a representative set of available haplotypes. Haplotypes are collapsed to make alignment more efficient, while retaining as much distinct haplotype information as possible. Collapsing is performed using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (upgma) tree from pairwise distance matrix from sequence variants to measure the similarity between haplotypes. Based on imputation accuracy tests, we chose a level of similarity (PHG parameter: maximum divergence) to collapse haplotypes of 0.001, corresponding to less than 1 in 1000 nucleotide differences between haplotypes. This level of collapsing maintains high accuracy while collapsing redundant haplotypes (Supplementary Figure S2). We then produced a pan-genome composed of consensus haplotypes representing the diversity of haplotypes., Once we obtained a set of consensus haplotypes, we implemented an HMM to infer genome-wide haplotypes from low-depth genotyping data. Sparse genotype information was created by downsampling whole-genome sequence data randomly using samtools to simulate skim sequencing. We randomly sampled 20 taxa from the cultivated varieties within the population to serve as a test set for downstream analyses, while using the remaining 221 clones for haplotype sampling. To test different levels of sequencing depth, we downsampled reads to amounts estimated to represent 0.1×, 0.5×, 1×, 5×, and 10× single-end, whole-genome sequence coverage. In addition, we tested imputation using available Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS) data for these lines., These sampled sequences were aligned to the consensus haplotypes stored in the PHG to impute whole-genome variants. A trellis graph is formed with every reference range representing separate ranges and the consensus haplotypes as nodes at each of those ranges. The most likely paths through the graph were then determined using an HMM Viterbi algorithm. Because cassava is heterozygous and diploid, this step produces the two most likely paths for each taxon. The emission and transition probability parameters of the HMM are defined by the genomes of the reference population used to build the database. The emission probabilities are calculated by considering the probability of two given haplotypes, given the aligned reads. The transition probabilities are defined by the edges between haplotypes in the PHG., Due to the sparse sampling of IBD haplotypes from heterozygous taxa used to produce the PHG, the database lacked abundant transition information between adjacent reference ranges. To compensate for this, we aligned WGS for all 241 taxa used to create the database and predicted most likely paths through the graph. These paths were then used to augment the transition probabilities, without contributing any additional haplotypes., We compared our imputation accuracy results to the common genotype imputation tool Beagle (Browning et al. 2018). Beagle was developed for the purpose of human data, but is a common tool used by many plant studies to impute missing genotypes. Because Beagle v4 has the ability to incorporate genotype likelihoods based on read depth, we used it for the imputation of the low-depth sequence when it improved accuracy, otherwise we utilized Beagle v5. We used the same HapMapII data from the 241 clones to impute missing genotypes with Beagle., Here, y^ is the predicted trait and μ is the fixed effect of the overall mean. Random effects were fitted as follows: G is genotype effect of the ith clone, B is the effect of the jth block, R is the effect of the kth replicate, L is the location of the lth location, Y is the effect of the mth year, GXL is the interactive effect of the ith clone and the lth location, and GXY is the interaction effect of the ith clone and the mth year. This was performed using the mixed model tool Echidna (Gilmour 2019)., We investigated the viability of using computationally phased haplotypes to curate a PHG database rather than relying on IBD regions of the genome. First, we phased the variants from the 241 cassava clones using a combination of Beagle (Browning et al. 2018) and HAPCUT2 (Edge et al. 2017). These variants were used to create a PHG to be tested against the IBD version of the PHG. The second test utilized Oxford Nanopore (ONP) long-read sequencing from six cassava clones within the HMII population. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from young cassava leaves, selected for fragments 20–80 kbp long, and sequenced with MinION following the manufacturer recommendations. Variants were called using Guppy and their variants phased with WhatsHap (Schrinner et al. 2020a). These six clones were then used to populate another PHG, we will identify as the “ONP6 PHG”. Larger reference ranges were divided into smaller regions to increase the probability of sampling correctly phased haplotypes. Twenty clones with the highest relationship to the six taxa with ONP data were used as the test set for these tests., A sample of 20 related individuals from the HapMapII population was selected to serve as parents for a simulated genotyping scenario. The genomes were phased using Beagle and then used to populate a PHG database. We then used these parents to simulate five generations of random mating given a population size of 100 (Figure 3). Forward genetic simulations were completed using SLiM (Haller and Messer 2019). Artificial short-read sequencing was then simulated for these offspring using neat-genreads (Stephens et al. 2016) at varied coverage levels. Reads were then aligned using bwa used to call and impute variants using Sentieon (Kendig et al. 2019) and Beagle. Reads were also aligned to the PHG formed from the original parents for imputation., Simulation methodology flowchart. Diagram of simulation scheme showing how simulated offspring were generated and used to test imputation accuracy under ideal haplotype sampling scenarios., Simulation methodology flowchart. Diagram of simulation scheme showing how simulated offspring were generated and used to test imputation accuracy under ideal haplotype sampling scenarios., To obtain phased haplotypes for the PHG, we sampled haplotypes from homozygous regions of each clone. Centuries of clonal propagation and reported inbreeding depression (de Freitas et al. 2016) suggest cassava germplasm would be highly heterozygous, however, we found that, on average, ∼20% of all reference ranges from each taxon were homozygous. This resulted in a high number of missing haplotypes in each taxon, but a high confidence in the phased haplotypes that were sampled. Despite the variability in the number of homozygous samples by reference range, >90% of the reference ranges were homozygous in at least 10% of the HapMapII population (Supplementary Figure S3). From these IBD haplotypes, we were able to sample ∼50% of the segregating sites. This proportion increased to 77% when considering sites with minor allele frequency above 5%, suggesting that many of the common variable sites have been sampled., Because imputation accuracy is dependent on the relative allele frequency and phase of the allele being called, we classified genotype calls by allele frequency class: homozygous major (both alleles are identical and have >50% allele frequency in HapMapII), homozygous minor (both alleles are identical and have <50% allele frequency in HapMapII), and heterozygous (two different alleles are present). In our analyses, imputation accuracy is defined as the ability of the imputation method to reconstitute genome-wide SNPs from the input data. We use the correlation between the predicted alleles and the true alleles (defined by HapMapII) as a metric to make the PHG and Beagle comparable, because the PHG utilizes reads and Beagle utilizes variants to make their predictions., Imputation of skim sequence genotyping showed PHG methods had a large advantage over Beagle using low-coverage sequence. At a level of 1× coverage random sequencing, the PHG predicted allele calls with a correlation of R2 = 0.84, while the correlation between Beagle predicted alleles and the true calls was R2 = 0.69 (Figure 4A). At higher depths of coverage (>5×), the raw data provide ample information to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, allowing Beagle to determine the correct genotype. The PHG, however, is able to distinguish between the available haplotypes at a coverage of 0.5× and adding additional sequence data does not increase the accuracy, as there is no correlation between accuracy and coverage beyond 0.5×., Imputation accuracy from skim sequencing.

(C) Imputation accuracy at 1× coverage is shown for homozygous genotypes separated by allele frequency of the true allele at that locus. (D) Imputation accuracy at 1× coverage is shown for heterozygous genotypes separated by minor allele frequency at that locus., The improved performance of the PHG is most noticeable in its accurate predictions of heterozygous and rare genotypes. The PHG was able to impute genotypes with high accuracy regardless of allele class (Figure 4B). The PHG’s high accuracy at low allele frequencies for both homozygous (Figure 4C) and heterozygous genotypes (Figure 4D) display its ability to impute rare alleles., In addition to skim sequence scenarios, we also tested imputation using available GBS sequence for 20 clones. While skim sequence samples a random set of reads from across the genome, GBS is a replicable set of markers that a sparsely sampled across the genome. Imputation tests showed similar, but somewhat reduced accuracies using the PHG compared to Beagle (Figure 5A). It is important to note, however, that the PHG still had improved accuracies in imputing heterozygous genotypes (Figure 5C)., Imputation accuracy from GBS sequencing.

(C) Imputation accuracy is shown for heterozygous genotypes separated by minor allele frequency at that locus., The imputed genotypes from skim sequence were then utilized in a genomic prediction scheme consisting of 57 cassava clones (Supplementary Figure S4) from a single breeding program. Clones were selected from a single breeding program to minimize confounding factors such as population structure and ensured an adequate level of heritability to assess genomic prediction accuracy. Tenfold cross-validations and leave-one-out validation showed that imputation accuracy generally appeared to follow the trends in genomic prediction accuracy, for fresh root yield and root number, while no clear pattern was apparent for the root size trait (Figure 6)., Genomic prediction cross-validation. Tenfold cross-validation (box) and single holdout cross-validation (line) show genomic prediction accuracies of three root traits using different imputation methods at varied sequence depths. Single holdout cross-validation using complete genotype dataset is shown (dashed line)., Genomic prediction cross-validation. Tenfold cross-validation (box) and single holdout cross-validation (line) show genomic prediction accuracies of three root traits using different imputation methods at varied sequence depths. Single holdout cross-validation using complete genotype dataset is shown (dashed line)., We tested the viability of populating the PHG with haplotypes phased by other methods. We compared the IBD method of sampling phased haplotypes to two methods of phasing variants. The first method used Beagle and HAPCUT2 to phase the variants called from the HapMapII WGS data. The second method utilized six cassava clones with ONP long-read data. The IBD and prephased methods of populating the cassava PHG produced almost identical accuracies (Figure 7). These results suggest that Beagle and HAPCUT could not accurately phase heterozygous haplotypes at this scale, and the accurate haplotypes are derived from IBD haplotypes. While the PHG was made from six clones with ONP data did perform as well as the other methods, it relied on a far narrower set of germplasm. This suggests that accurate haplotypes were likely captured using this method but lacked adequate sampling to capture sufficient haplotypes., Haplotype phasing methods in the PHG. Imputation accuracy is shown for three different methods of populating a PHG. First, the IBD PHG (red) was populated using homozygous haplotypes from the 241 HapMapII clones. Second, the Prephased PHG (Purple) used Beagle and HPACUT2 to phase these same clones. Third, the ONP6 PHG (Yellow) used ONP long reads and WhatsHap to phase six related taxa to the test set., Haplotype phasing methods in the PHG. Imputation accuracy is shown for three different methods of populating a PHG. First, the IBD PHG (red) was populated using homozygous haplotypes from the 241 HapMapII clones. Second, the Prephased PHG (Purple) used Beagle and HPACUT2 to phase these same clones. Third, the ONP6 PHG (Yellow) used ONP long reads and WhatsHap to phase six related taxa to the test set., Evident from the tests using haplotypes from IBD regions of the genome, sampling phased haplotypes is a difficult aspect of creating an effective PHG in a heterozygous species. To explore the performance of the PHG in a scenario where one could aptly sample the diversity of haplotypes, we used simulated offspring from a set of 20 phased genomes. While phasing errors exist, we accepted these phases as truth for the simulation of offspring. This ensured that all haplotypes present in the offspring exist in the PHG database. We found that the disparity in accuracies between PHG and Beagle at high sequence coverage disappeared in our simulation (Figure 8), while the trend in Beagle accuracy was very similar to our empirical tests. While the simulation does represent an ideal scenario, including a narrower set of germplasm, it highlights the performance of the PHG when accurately phased haplotypes are available., Imputation accuracy with simulated genotypes. A simulated scenario where 20 parents with full phased information are used to populate a PHG. Correlation between imputed and true variants by imputing with the PHG and Beagle at different levels of skim sequencing., Imputation accuracy with simulated genotypes. A simulated scenario where 20 parents with full phased information are used to populate a PHG. Correlation between imputed and true variants by imputing with the PHG and Beagle at different levels of skim sequencing., We have detailed a method of implementing a PHG for the heterozygous plant species cassava. This PHG database utilizes phased haplotypes to predict missing genotypes from low-depth input sequence. Runs of homozygosity formed by IBD relationships proved to be a reliable method of sampling phased haplotypes given the available data (Figure 7). This method of obtaining haplotypes, while not able obtain the full diversity of alleles, captured 77% of common alleles and produced ample haplotypes for significant imputation accuracy at very low sequence depth (Figure 4A)., The high accuracy of the PHG demonstrates its potential as an imputation tool for use in heterozygous crops. The advantages of the PHG imputation methodology are especially evident in its accuracy at calling rare and heterozygous alleles (Figure 4, C and D). Furthermore, the observed weaker relationship between allele frequency and imputation accuracy, highlights its ability to predict rare alleles. Across both simulated and empirical experiments, we found that the ability of the PHG to impute whole-genome variants was consistent at or above 0.5× sequence coverage. The haplotype-based representation of the genome enables this imputation methodology to overcome the logistical hurdles such as those produced by sequencing and assembly errors, repetitive sequences, and poor alignments., The plateau reached in imputation accuracy (Figure 4A) using the PHG most likely indicates that we have not sufficiently sampled the diversity of possible haplotypes. At sequence coverages of 5× and higher, the raw data can produce the true genotypes and little imputation of missing genotypes is occurring. The PHG imputation is limited to predicting haplotypes that are already present in the database, while Beagle can rely on the genotypes called from the high depth (>1×) raw sequence, meaning that there are much fewer missing data for Beagle to impute. This scenario of high depth sequence is useful to diagnose challenges in imputation, however it does not correlate to many real applications. The disparity between the PHG and Beagle at these high coverages points to the presence of missing haplotypes in the database, rather than any disparity in performance., The hypothesis of missing haplotypes limiting imputation accuracy is supported by a visible relationship between homozygous incidence in our population and reference range imputation accuracy (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that those ranges with poor imputation accuracy were not amply sampled. The length and abundance of the IBD runs of homozygosity in our dataset likely determine the ability of the HMM to accurately predict haplotypes. There may be many factors that affect the prevalence of IBD haplotypes including recessive deleterious effects, populations size, population diversity, and heterozygosity. We saw that the disparity in imputation accuracy was remedied under simulation, where all possible haplotypes were sampled in the database (Figure 8). These results suggest that, although an already powerful tool, the PHG achieves maximum performance with sufficient sampling of available haplotypes., Currently, the performance using GBS data appears to be similar between the PHG and Beagle (Figure 5). Imputation from reduced representation genotyping such as GBS is challenging due to the sparse sampling across the genome and varied levels of sequence quality. Excellent imputation accuracy in inbred crops Sorghum (Jensen et al. 2020) and Maize (Valdes Franco 2020) using these genotyping methods highlights the potential benefits of the PHG in these scenarios. Because reduced representation genotyping methods are likely the most commonly implemented, current efforts are being made to improve heterozygous imputation using these technologies. We expect improved haplotype sampling and phasing to improve imputation accuracy for these genotyping platforms. Further haplotype sampling paired with developments in the PHG imputation methodology will likely improve imputation accuracy from these genotyping methods., While the imputation accuracy of the PHG is limited based on the haplotype sampling, its high accuracy with low levels of input sequence highlights its potential for genomic applications, where sparse genotyping is common. We showed that this is true regarding genomic prediction by performing cross-validations with the imputed genotypes (Figure 3). The genomic prediction was still limited by imputation accuracy, but by enabling higher accuracy we can achieve more reliable predictions (Piment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
l et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016; Van Den Berg et al. 2017)., With increased imputation accuracy from more limited genotyping inputs, a breeding program may be able to afford to cross and genotype more offspring, enabling them to increase selection pressure across their breeding pool. Similarly, imputation to genome-wide scale can bridge gaps between different data sets containing information on different marker panels, enabling the use of larger datasets for prediction. Accurate imputation could also enable breeders to utilize genomic prediction models that incorporate more prior functional information on genome-wide variant effects into predictions, using methods such as GFBLUP (Fang et al. 2017) or BayesR (MacLeod et al. 2016; Van Den Berg et al. 2017). These possible applications of imputation have the potential to increase total genetic gain made by breeding programs., We show that while computational methods might not be able to solve haplotype phasing with short-read data, long-read sequencing may be able to overcome that issue. The Prephased PHG produced similar accuracies to the IBD method, suggesting the additional haplotypes added by phasing why heterozygous alleles using Beagle and HAPCUT were not accurate over long distances. While limited in scope, the ability of the PHG created from six clones with ONP data suggests the potential application of long reads for obtaining phased haplotypes. One could envision a breeding scenario in which parents are sequenced and phased using long-reads and offspring are predicted from minimal genotyping input using the PHG. Then every few generations shallow WGS can be used to update the PHG and compensate for changing LD structures., Applying the PHG to cassava and other heterozygous crops will depend on the ability to sample phased haplotypes within the given population. We’ve shown that utilizing high depth WGS data and IBD regions of the genome can be used to reliably sample many phased haplotypes, and that the resulting PHG can impute with high accuracy from low-depth sequence. This method of sampling haplotypes will be highly dependent on the diversity and heterozygosity of the species and population for any given application. Other necessary considerations for the decision to use the PHG include genome size, reference genome quality, training data availability, species ploidy. In applications where imputation is commonly implemented, training data that can be used to construct a PHG may already be available. Our long-read data results show the potential for more easily capturing phased haplotypes as these technologies become more available. Using genome assemblies produced from long-reads as inputs to the PHG has been shown to be very effective in Maize, while this method has not been implemented in outbred species. The potential for the PHG as a tool in heterozygous crops has been shown here, while the specific methods to produce the phased haplotypes will have to be designed around the target species and scenario., The PHG is a method to reduce a genome to a set of haplotypes. We have shown that this method can be used to predict whole-genome haplotypes in a heterozygous species from sparse genotyping information. Its high accuracy, especially in rare alleles, at very low depths of skim sequencing makes it a potentially powerful imputation tool. Continued work in populating the PHG database with confidently phased haplotypes will lead to a more consistent prediction model across varied genotyping methods., Supplementary files and scripts used for the production and testing of the cassava PHG can be found at https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/p_cassava_phg.

This is shown with imputed data from UK Biobank and simulations., Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have classically been done to study genotype–phenotype associations. However, a slightly different design of GWAS is using low depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, because in such cases the genotype cannot be inferred accurately. Low depth sequencing provides a cost-efficient design, where the number of individuals studied can be increased many folds compared with high depth sequencing, since each individual will be a lot cheaper to sequence. The statistical power to detect associations increases with the number of individuals while only dropping slightly with lower depth and therefore this design provides good statistical power to detect associations (Pasaniuc et al. 2012). Another approach that is commonly used in GWAS is performing haplotype imputation from SNP-chips to infer missing genotypes which also generates genetic data with uncertainty on the inferred genotype., A recent successful GWAS (Liu et al. 2018) with low depth NGS data has shown the viability of this approach. In Liu et al. (2018), around 140,000 individuals had a noninvasive prenatal test for fetal trisomy with low depth sequencing with an average sequencing depth of 0.1X⁠. Haplotype imputation was performed on the low depth NGS data. For the association testing a score test approach using a linear model framework (Skotte et al. 2012) implemented in ANGSD (Korneliussen et al. 2014) was used, as this method takes genotype uncertainty into account. Despite the low sequencing depth several novel associations were discovered. This provides an example of a study where using methods that account for the genotype uncertainty in low depth NGS data, provides good statistical power for detecting associations., In association studies, genotype uncertainty can be taken into account using a latent variable model that sums over the possible genotype states. Using latent variable models can have advantages compared with calling genotypes for low depth NGS data (Skotte et al. 2012). Skotte et al. (2012) implemented a score test where the coefficients are not estimated under the alternative hypothesis making the method computationally very fast; however, this means the effect size of the genotype is not estimated. In this article, we will introduce ANGSD-asso’s latent model, it works in a generalized linear model (GLM) framework; it estimates the effect size of the unobserved genotype. This method can in practice be run almost as fast as the score test. ANGSD-asso’s latent model uses a maximum likelihood approach; more specifically, we will make use of the EM algorithm to maximize the likelihood, treating the unobserved genotype G as a latent variable. Using a GLM framework enables us to include covariates thereby adjusting for possible confounders, such as population structure. We have implemented an EM algorithm that converges fast and that can be run multi-threaded, making the analysis of large data sets possible. We have also implemented a hybrid model in ANGSD-asso combining the speed of the score test with the desired properties of the EM algorithm-based approach. Using the EM algorithm for doing maximum likelihood estimation in a GLM framework using genotype probabilities has been implemented in SNPTEST (Marchini et al. 2007). However, SNPTEST cannot jointly estimate effect sizes of genotype and covariates and is not computationally efficient. We have designed a faster implementation that allows for the association analysis of large-scale NGS data sets., A common practice for performing association analysis based on genotype probabilities is using genetic dosages, which are the expected genotypes calculated from the genotype probabilities. Dosages are easy to implement into most existing methods as the genotype can be directly replaced by the dosage. However, dosages do not convey the uncertainty on the genotype as fully as genotype likelihoods or genotype probabilities. In Zheng et al. (2011), they show a gain in power when using genotype probability-based methods compared with dosages, but only for small studies with variants with large effect sizes. However, they did not look at how sequencing depth and phenotype correlation might affect this. This could happen in a case-control study, if cases and controls were sequenced at different places, or if the total data set is merged from other smaller heterogeneous data sets, creating a systematic difference in the sequencing depth. We investigate this sequencing depth bias through simulations of a large-scale association study and evaluate the performance of our genotype probability-based method compared with using dosages. In order to be able to assess how a sequencing depth bias might impact the analyses, we focus on simulating genetic data as low depth NGS data. However, we show that a scenario similar to this could also happen with data based on haplotype imputation., ANGSD-asso, and the score test and SNPTEST all work on genotype probabilities (also known as the “posterior probability”). The genotype probabilities can be calculated from the genotype likelihoods, which in turn can be calculated from the NGS data (Nielsen et al. 2011). For more on genotype likelihoods and NGS data see Supplementary Section S5.2., Another aspect, we will explore is how to estimate genotype probabilities taking population structure into account, when performing association studies with low depth sequencing data. Population structure is a common confounder in association studies that need to be addressed properly (Cardon and Palmer 2003; Freedman et al. 2004; Marchini et al. 2004). For low depth sequencing data, the genotype probabilities are often obtained by using a prior based on the allele frequency estimated from the same sequencing data. We will refer to this allele frequency as the “sample allele frequency”. Using this prior assumes a homogeneous population without population structure. We therefore propose to use a different prior when dealing with structured populations based on individual allele frequencies. The individual allele frequency is the weighted average population frequency where the admixture proportions for each individual are the weights. The individual allele frequency for a site has to be calculated for each individual, as their admixture proportions might differ. This takes both the frequency of the variant and the ancestry of every individual into account. We therefore want to investigate how this approach compares to using the sample allele frequency prior in different scenarios. We will look at this both with regard to statistical power the false positive rate., NGS produces short reads that are mapped to a reference genome. From the aligned reads the probability of observing these reads at a given site for a certain genotype can be calculated. This is known as the genotype likelihood (Nielsen et al. 2011). For more on the genotype likelihood and how to calculate it see the Supplementary Section S5.2. The genotype likelihoods together with a genotype prior can be used to calculate the probability of the genotype given the data which is referred to as the genotype probability. For an overview of the relationship between the different kinds of genetic data, and how they can be processed and analyzed in association studies see Figure 1., Schematic of workflow for performing association studies with genetic data. x is the sequence data that can be converted to genotype likelihoods, G is the genotypes. π is the individual allele frequencies and f is the sample allele frequency both of which can be used as priors when estimating the genotype probabilities. Data either gets generated using SNP-chips or doing NGS. The NGS data can be converted into genotype probabilities assuming no population structure using the sample allele frequency, or assuming population structure and then using principal component analysis (PCA) to generate genotype probabilities. SNP-chip genotypes can be analyzed directly. Both kinds of data can be imputed using haplotype frequencies for generating genotype probabilities. The genotype probabilities can be analyzed with ANGSD-asso’s latent model or converted to dosages and then be analyzed with a GLM., Schematic of workflow for performing association studies with genetic data. x is the sequence data that can be converted to genotype likelihoods, G is the genotypes. π is the individual allele frequencies and f is the sample allele frequency both of which can be used as priors when estimating the genotype probabilities.

The genotype probabilities can be analyzed with ANGSD-asso’s latent model or converted to dosages and then be analyzed with a GLM., Equation (4) is the log-likelihood function that we want to maximize with regard to the parameters θ. For maximization, we use the EM algorithm where our latent variable is the unobserved genotype G. This is done by weighted least squares regression, where the parameters θ are estimated. For the full derivations of this see the Supplementary Sections S7 and S7.1. We have also implemented logistic and Poisson regression where we have introduced a link function for ηi for Equation (5) and changed the distribution for p(yi|G,zi,θ) accordingly. For more information on this see the Supplementary Section S6., Furthermore, standard errors on the estimated effect sizes are estimated using the observed Fisher information matrix as in Lake et al. (2003) and Skotte et al. (2019). In order to achieve faster convergence of the latent model, we first do regression on the genotype dosages. We then use the coefficients obtained from the dosage regression as the starting guess for the coefficients for the EM algorithm (we refer to this as priming)., The three methods in ANGSD-asso for association analysis are implemented in the ANGSD framework (Korneliussen et al. 2014), allowing multi-threaded analysis. ANGSD can be downloaded from its github page: https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd. The latent variable model is -doAsso 4, the hybrid model (see Supplementary Methods) is -doAsso 5 and the dosage model (see Supplementary Methods) is -doAsso 6. ANGSD-asso works on genotype probabilities in the BEAGLE, BGEN, and BCF/VCF file formats or directly from BAM files and the other file formats allowed in ANGSD., We simulate the phenotypes under a standard additive model with a normally distributed phenotype. The mean given is given by effect β from the genotype (g) and the ancestry/admixture proportions (q) with effect γ from being population 1 and SD 1, according to Equation (5). The mean for each simulation can also be seen in the last column of Table 1. We simulate different scenarios respectively with and without effect of the genotype, ancestry or sequencing depth, in order to be able to assess how each of them affects the result. Specifically, we wanted to explore scenarios where ancestry had a strong effect and we therefore chose γ to have a value of 1. Furthermore, for the genotype effect size β, we chose a range of values that we deemed realistic. Finally, we also wanted to explore the impact of correlation between sequencing depth and the phenotype, and how to handle this. We therefore introduced sequencing depth and phenotype correlation in our simulations. Essentially, this means that having a large phenotype value or being a case will make it more likely that an individual is in the high depth group. This is described in more detail in Supplementary Sections S1.3 and S4., Overview of simulations, We simulate under a standard additive model with a normally distributed phenotype with a mean given in the last column, and SD 1, according to Equation (5). N is the number of individuals, g is the genotype with effect size β and q is the ancestry proportion with effect sizeγ. In scenarios 1 and 3, there is no effect of the genotype. In scenarios 3, 4, and 6, there is population structure with two ancestral populations with allele frequency of 0.9 and 0.1. The sequencing depth and phenotype correlation are simulated using (Equation 5;Supplementary Methods)., Overview of simulations, We simulate under a standard additive model with a normally distributed phenotype with a mean given in the last column, and SD 1, according to Equation (5). N is the number of individuals, g is the genotype with effect size β and q is the ancestry proportion with effect sizeγ. In scenarios 1 and 3, there is no effect of the genotype. In scenarios 3, 4, and 6, there is population structure with two ancestral populations with allele frequency of 0.9 and 0.1. The sequencing depth and phenotype correlation are simulated using (Equation 5;Supplementary Methods)., We wanted to assess which prior performs best for generating the genotype probabilities when performing association studies with low depth sequencing data. We simulate different scenarios with and without population structure and with and without sequencing depth and phenotype correlation. For each of these scenarios, we both applied a sample allele frequency prior and an individual allele frequency prior and evaluated their performance with regard to false positive rate and statistical power to detect an association. Genotype dosages or the expected genotypes are often used in association studies, in order to try and account for the uncertainty on the genotype. However, dosages can be uninformative especially with low depth sequencing data. We did simulations in order to investigate the statistical power to detect an association, when we model the full genotype probabilities instead of using just the genotype dosage. We use ANGSD-asso latent model and dosage model for this. Last, we compared ANGSD-asso latent model with the similar model in SNPTEST in terms of bias, statistical power and computational speed. An overview of the simulation scenarios is shown in Table 1., In scenario 1, we simulate data without genotype effect, and population structure but with sequencing depth and phenotype correlation. We observe no inflation of the false positive rate for both priors (Supplementary Figure S1). This is expected since these priors become identical in the absence of population structure. In scenario 2, we add a genotype effect and again we observe no difference in the two priors in terms of statistical power (Supplementary Figure S2)., In scenario 3, we simulate population structure and sequencing depth and phenotype correlation. As shown in Figure 2, using the sample allele frequency prior gives biased estimates of the effect size and leads to an increased false positive rate. The increased false positive rate is present even though we are adjusting for ancestry in the linear model, showing that this is not sufficient in this scenario. When using the individual allele frequency prior, we do not get biased estimates and have a false positive rate that is identical to using the true genotype. In scenario 4, we remove correlation between sequencing depth and phenotype and use a range of effect sizes for the genotype. Figure 3 shows that using the individual allele frequency prior has increased statistical power compared with the sample allele frequency prior. For example for an effect size of β=0.3 the power is 0.74 compared with 0.61. Furthermore, in this scenario, we see that using dosages has similar statistical power to using genotype probabilities. When using the sample allele frequency prior the effect sizes are underestimated. This is due to the fact that using the individual allele frequency better describes the expected genotype in a structured population., Simulation scenario 3 without genotype effect but with population structure and with varying degree of sequencing depth and phenotype correlation (δ). There is an effect of ancestry of population 1 (γ = 1) which is adjusted for in the linear model. We use a significance threshold of 10−3⁠. Each point is based on 10,000 simulations each of 1000 individuals.

(A) Statistical power to detect an association, using ANGSD-asso’s latent model and dosage model respectively with a sample frequency prior (f) and an individual allele frequency prior (π). (B) Bias of the estimated effect sizes., In scenario 5, we remove population structure but reintroduce correlation between sequencing depth and phenotype and use a range of effect sizes for the genotype. Supplementary Figures S3b and S4b show that in this scenario there is slightly increased statistical power when using the full genotype probabilities compared with using dosages, and that our estimated effect size is less biased. In scenario 6, we have correlation between sequencing depth and phenotype, population structure and use a range of effect sizes for the genotype. Supplementary Figures S5b and S6b show that in this scenario there is increased statistical power when using the full genotype probabilities compared with using dosages, and less bias of the estimated effect size., To evaluate the effect of estimating the admixture proportions from a limited number of genetic sites, we ran simulations with a varying number of sites used for estimating the admixture proportions. We observe a bias in effect size and a reduction in power when a small number (50 or 500) of sites is used. However, when the number of sites is increased (5000 or 50,000), there is very little reduction in power or bias (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) compared with using the true admixture proportions., To further explore the performance difference with dosages, we simulated a large case-control study with 100,000 individuals. All individuals have low depth sequencing data but the cases and controls have different average sequencing depths., In Table 2, we show that using full genotype probabilities has increased statistical power compared with when using genotype dosages. We have more power for small effect sizes, where we have a true positive rate that is almost 0.1 higher. We calculated the info measure for our dosages in cases and controls respectively, to make it comparable with haplotype imputation. To calculate the info measure, we used the ratio of observed variance of the dosages to the expected binomial variance at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, as used in the imputation software MACH (Scott et al. 2007). When genotypes are predicted with high certainty the info measure will be close to 1. We see that the info measure is lower in controls, where we have a lower average sequencing depth. Supplementary Figures S3, a and b and S4, a and b show that in scenario 5, with a quantitative trait, there is also increased statistical power and less bias when using full genotype probabilities. It also shows that in these simulations when keeping individuals with 0 reads, there is less bias but similar statistical power. In Table 3, we run the analysis from Table 2, but including individuals with 0 reads. In this scenario, the difference between using dosages and genotype probabilities has been almost erased. However, it is worth noticing that in this scenario, we lose statistical power compared with when we remove individuals with 0 reads. To further investigate these scenarios, we looked at the bias of the estimated effect sizes. Supplementary Figures S9 and S10 show for a relative risk (RR) of 1.14 that the latent model gives less biased estimates of the effect sizes compared with dosages., The statistical power for different simulated effect sizes or RRs of the genotype, The phenotype is simulated as a binary trait. We have performed 10,000 simulations for each effect size. The causal allele of the genetic variant has a frequency of 0.05 and the disease has a prevalence of 0.10 in the population. We use a significance threshold of 10−5⁠. We have used the sample allele frequency prior as there is no population structure. We simulated 50,000 controls and cases respectively, with an average sequencing depth of 1X and 4X, respectively. We have removed individuals with 0 reads (0X). The R2 values denote how well the true genotype is predicted with this data and are calculated like the info measure used in the MACH imputation software (Scott et al. 2007)., The statistical power for different simulated effect sizes or RRs of the genotype, The phenotype is simulated as a binary trait.

Last, if we do scenario 6, but for a binary phenotype, we show increased statistical power and a smaller bias of the effect size, when using genotype probabilities compared with dosages as shown in Supplementary Figures S7, a and b and S8, a and b. And that in these simulations removing individuals with 0 reads, leads to increased statistical power and less bias., SNPTEST (Marchini et al. 2007) also implements a latent model for performing association (using the option -method em) with genotype probabilities also using a GLM framework. We applied both methods to the imputed data of UK Biobank (Bycroft et al. 2018); more specifically, we chose a 50 kb region of chromosome 2 (219,675–219,725 kb), which has the genetic variant rs78058190. This variant has been found to be associated with waist–hip ratio in Kichaev et al. (2019) and the association is even stronger when adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (Pulit et al. 2019). It is an imputed variant in the UK Biobank data (info/R2 = 0.778797, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.049; Bycroft et al. 2018). We therefore ran both methods on the genotype probabilities from the imputation for this region, adjusting for gender, age, BMI, and top 10 genetic PCs (from UK Biobank), with waist–hip ratio as the phenotype but inverse quantile transformed to a standard normal distribution. ANGSD-asso’s latent model runs this analysis of 292,432 individuals and 1647 genetic variants in 82.13 min (17.71 min with 20 threads), SNPTEST runs this in 175.64 min (no multi-threaded option). The estimated effect sizes from each method are compared in Figure 4, showing that the estimated effect sizes are very similar. However, SNPTEST adjusts for covariates by first regressing out the covariates (plus an intercept) on the phenotype doing ordinary least squares. SNPTEST then subsequently uses the EM algorithm to obtain estimates of the intercept and genotype effect. This approach can lead to bias in the estimated effect size of the tested variant when adjusting with covariates that are both correlated with the phenotype and the tested variant (Freckleton 2002; Vansteelandt et al., 2009). For example, when performing conditional analysis on other genetic variants, in order to determine if the tested variant might be the casual variant. We show using the UK Biobank data (Bycroft et al. 2018), that SNPTEST estimates lower effect sizes when adjusting for a covariate with high correlation to the focal variant (rs113414093) which is a consequence of regressing out the covariate prior to testing the variant (Table 4). When testing the three variants (rs1134114093, rs116204487, and rs148358468), but adjusting for rs78058190, we obtain similar results for ANGSD-asso and SNPTEST (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2)., Estimated effect sizes from respectively SNPTEST and ANGSD-asso’s latent model of the overlapping 1596 genetic variants, between the two analyses. These estimates are based on the imputed data from the UK Biobank of a 50-kb region on chromosome 2 (219,675–219,725 kb). Both analyses have been adjusted for top 10 genetics PCs as provided by the UK Biobank data, age, gender, and BMI, the analyzed trait is waist–hip ratio from the UK Biobank data that has been inverse quantile transformed to a standard normal distribution., Estimated effect sizes from respectively SNPTEST and ANGSD-asso’s latent model of the overlapping 1596 genetic variants, between the two analyses.

Results for rs113414093, rs116204487, and rs148358468 conditional on rs78058190 can be found in Supplementary Table S1 and S2., SNPTEST can also be shown to be biased in simulations. We simulated a scenario with population structure that is both correlated with the phenotype and the genotype. Supplementary Figure S12 shows that in this scenario SNPTEST’s effect sizes are downward biased, whereas ANGSD-asso’s latent model has no bias, when using the individual allele frequency prior, and it also has increased statistical power compared with SNPTEST. We have used the most recent version of SNPTEST (v2.5.4-beta3). We ran all analyses with SNPTEST on the same data as ANGSD-asso, meaning disabling the option of transforming covariates and phenotype in SNPTEST., As shown in Supplementary Figure S11 priming ANGSD-asso’s EM algorithm with the coefficients from regression on dosages drastically reduces the number of iterations needed for convergence of the EM algorithm., We also compared ANGSD-asso’s latent model to SNPTEST in terms of computational speed and found that ANGSD-asso’s latent model is faster than SNPTEST, especially for binary data, as shown in Figure 5, and for quantitative data as shown in Supplementary Figure S13. ANGSD-asso’s latent model is capable of analyzing data sets of 100,000 individuals in <10 h. Our hybrid approach can handle the analyses in <17 h unthreaded. SNPTEST will take days to run the largest data set, when running a logistic model., Running times for an analysis of a simulated binary trait with 442,769 genetic variants, varying the number of individuals (1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000), the model is run with two covariates (age and gender).

roach compared with the score test (Skotte et al. 2012), is that the effect size of the unobserved genotype is estimated. The effect size helps provide further insights into the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Furthermore, the estimated effect sizes also mean, we can make use of LD-score regression (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015). It is shown using UK Biobank data and simulations that ANGSD-asso’s latent model has increased statistical power and less bias compared with SNPTEST, when including covariates that are correlated with both phenotype and genotype in the model (Table 4 and Supplementary Figure S12). This is due to SNPTEST adjusting for covariates by first regressing them on the phenotype and then running the EM algorithm on the residuals. Including covariates in the linear model is a common way to deal with confounders in association studies. Also, it is shown that ANGSD-asso’s latent model is much faster than SNPTEST., We have chosen to compare our method to SNPTEST as it is the only other method commonly used that takes genotype uncertainty into account. Additionally, almost all GWAS that use dosages are based on a standard GLM which will give identical results regardless of the method used. We therefore felt, it was not necessary to compare the dosage method with other software implementations. There are some exceptions to using standard GLMs. One of the exceptions is the use of dosages in linear mixed models which we have not explored in this study., We have shown how using the individual allele frequency prior, when estimating genotype probabilities, gives better statistical power to detect an association, when dealing with NGS data with population structure as shown in Figure 3. Also, it removes issues with an increased false positives rate when there is sequencing depth phenotype correlation as shown in Figure 2. This correlation might arise if the sequencing is not randomized, for example, if cases and controls are being sequenced at different times or places thereby creating a systematic bias, or if different cohorts have been sequenced at different places, or if the trait of interest is much more prevalent at one place vs. another. The scenarios from Table 1 are most likely to arise when dealing with nonmodel species where imputation cannot be done. This leads us to recommend using the individual allele frequency prior when performing association studies with NGS data in structured populations, where imputation is not possible. Whether it is better to base the individual allele frequency prior from clustering using NGSadmix (Skotte et al. 2013) or using PCA using PCAngsd (Meisner and Albrechtsen 2018) depends on the individuals in the data. If the sampled individuals are recent descendants of fairly discrete populations, such as most African Americans, then a clustering approach will give the most accurate allele frequencies while if the structure is more continuous such as many Latino Americans, then PCA might be a better approach., In Tables 2 and 3, we show through simulations increased statistical power when using genotype probabilities compared with dosages, with a larger gain in power for the scenario from Table 2. Since individuals with 0 reads are also removed from the true genotype in Table 2, there is higher statistical power for the true genotype in Table 3 as there are more individuals. In both instances, it is a case-control study with low depth sequencing data, where cases and controls have different average sequencing depths. A scenario like this, where there is better genotype information for some individuals, could also arise from haplotype imputation. As shown in Tables 2 and 3 with the info measure (R2) for controls and cases, where cases have more informative genetic data. This could happen if a certain population is not being represented in the reference panel used for imputation or if different reference panels or SNP-chips are used for cases and controls. A systematic difference in imputation quality is roughly equivalent to having a different average sequencing depth. However, at the same time, we have to state that our simulations and our analyses have shown us that in many instances dosages perform just as well. However, as mentioned there are certain circumstances where they do not perform as well. We have tried to explore these circumstances in this article and what the impact of them is., Another conclusion, we can draw from our simulations is that when there is sequencing depth and phenotype correlation, our estimates of the effect size will be biased when we do not know the true frequency as shown in Supplementary Figures S4, S6, and S8. Furthermore, when there is sequencing depth and phenotype correlation it seems that keeping individuals with 0 reads makes a difference; however, this is due to how the simulations were performed and might not generalize to all scenarios., With ANGSD-asso implemented in ANGSD, we have made it possible to perform large association studies with low depth sequencing data retaining maximal statistical power, and also estimating effect sizes. SNPTEST is too slow for the analysis of large-scale data sets. The speed-up of ANGSD-asso’s latent model compared with SNPTEST is due to priming for faster convergence of the EM algorithm and threaded analysis using the ANGSD (Korneliussen et al. 2014) framework. ANGSD-asso makes the analysis of large-scale data possible as done in Liu et al. (2018) (141,431 individuals) while retaining maximal statistical power., The three methods in ANGSD-asso for association analysis are implemented in the ANGSD framework.

Cytochrome P450 genes were the predominant over-expressed detoxification genes in FUMOZ, with high expression of the duplicated CYP6P9a (fold-change of 82.23 vs FANG) and CYP6P9b (FC 11.15). Other over-expressed P450s belonged to the same cluster of P450s corresponding to the resistance to pyrethroid 1 (rp1) quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 2R. Several Epsilon class glutathione S-transferases were also over-expressed in FUMOZ, as was the ATP-binding cassette transporter AFUN019220 (ABCA) which also exhibited between-strain alternative splicing events at exon 7. Significant differences in single-nucleotide polymorphism frequencies between strains occurred in resistance QTLs rp1 (CYP6P9a/b and CYP6AA1), rp2 on chromosome 2L (CYP6Z1, CYP6M7, and CYP6Z3), and rp3 on chromosome 3R (CYP9J5, CYP9J4, and CYP9J3). Differences were also detected in CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 genes on the X chromosome, both of which are associated with cuticular resistance in Anopheles gambiae. A close analysis of nonsynonymous diversity at the CYP6P9a/b loci revealed a drastic loss of diversity in FUMOZ with only a single polymorphism and 2 haplotypes vs 18 substitutions and 8 haplotypes in FANG. By contrast, a lowly expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP4C36) did not exhibit diversity differences between strains. We also detected the known pyrethroid resistance conferring amino acid change N384S in CYP6P9b. This study further elucidates the molecular bases of resistance in An. funestus, informing strategies to better manage widespread resistance across Africa.","malaria, mosquito, Anopheles funestus, pyrethroid resistance, metabolic resistance, RNAseq, cytochrome P450s","Insecticide-based interventions, notably long-lasting insecticidal nets, against mosquito vectors of malaria are currently threatened by pyrethroid resistance.

Other over-expressed P450s belonged to the same cluster of P450s corresponding to the resistance to pyrethroid 1 (rp1) quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 2R. Several Epsilon class glutathione S-transferases were also over-expressed in FUMOZ, as was the ATP-binding cassette transporter AFUN019220 (ABCA) which also exhibited between-strain alternative splicing events at exon 7. Significant differences in single-nucleotide polymorphism frequencies between strains occurred in resistance QTLs rp1 (CYP6P9a/b and CYP6AA1), rp2 on chromosome 2L (CYP6Z1, CYP6M7, and CYP6Z3), and rp3 on chromosome 3R (CYP9J5, CYP9J4, and CYP9J3). Differences were also detected in CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 genes on the X chromosome, both of which are associated with cuticular resistance in Anopheles gambiae. A close analysis of nonsynonymous diversity at the CYP6P9a/b loci revealed a drastic loss of diversity in FUMOZ with only a single polymorphism and 2 haplotypes vs 18 substitutions and 8 haplotypes in FANG. By contrast, a lowly expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP4C36) did not exhibit diversity differences between strains. We also detected the known pyrethroid resistance conferring amino acid change N384S in CYP6P9b. This study further elucidates the molecular bases of resistance in An. funestus, informing strategies to better manage widespread resistance across Africa., Malaria prevention still heavily relies on insecticide-based interventions including long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying. These tools have contributed massively to the reduction of malaria burden observed since 2000 (Bhatt et al. 2015). LLINs have mainly relied on pyrethroid insecticides due to their low toxicity to humans. Unfortunately, major malaria vectors have developed resistance to pyrethroids as a response to the massive scale up of LLINs (Hemingway et al. 2016), and also due to ongoing selection from agricultural use of insecticides (WHO 2012). There is increasing evidence that this resistance is jeopardizing the efficacy of LLINs (Mugenzi et al. 2019; Weedall et al. 2019) and is compromising the success of malaria control programs (Protopopoff et al. 2018). It is vital to implement suitable resistance management strategies to prevent the loss of all the gains recently achieved in reducing malaria burdens (Hemingway et al. 2016). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in major malaria vectors such as Anopheles funestus, a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa alongside members of the Anopheles gambiae complex is, therefore, of great importance for tracking and managing this resistance., There are primarily two major mechanisms by which insecticide resistance occurs in mosquitoes, namely target-site and metabolic resistance (Hemingway and Ranson 2000; Hemingway et al. 2004). Target-site resistance occurs when the mosquito target of an insecticide changes in such a manner as to prevent an insecticide from functioning, for example by reduced binding affinity. Pyrethroid class insecticides target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) of insects and several mutations of VGSC labeled “knock down” or kdr mutations have been identified in several mosquito species (Hemingway and Ranson 2000; Hemingway et al. 2004). Intriguingly, kdr mutations have yet to be seen in An. funestus (Irving and Wondji 2017) but are common in other Anopheles vectors (Riveron et al. 2018a). Metabolic resistance is the rapid destruction or removal of insecticides by resistant vs susceptible insects and is mediated by more efficient and/or higher levels of detoxifying enzymes (Hemingway et al. 2004). This mechanism is predominant in An. funestus resistance to pyrethroids and occurs through the over-expression of cytochrome P450 class genes (Riveron et al. 2018a). Glutathione S-transferases and carboxylesterases can also act to detoxify various insecticides through elevated expression (Riveron et al. 2018a)., In recent years, increasing resistance to multiple insecticides has been reported in An. funestus species with the first reports emerging from southern Africa (Hargreaves et al. 2000; Casimiro et al. 2006; Cuamba et al. 2010; Riveron et al. 2015). Resistance to pyrethroids has been gradually reported in other regions of Africa from including West (Djouaka et al. 2011, 2016; Samb et al. 2016), Central (Menze et al. 2016, 2018; Riveron et al. 2018b), and East (Morgan et al. 2010; Kawada et al. 2011; Mulamba et al. 2014), which has spurred efforts to generate new insecticides with different modes of action to maintain control of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes (Hemingway et al. 2016). However, it is vital to avoid potential cross-resistance between forthcoming novel insecticides and pyrethroids. Hence, it is important to use laboratory pyrethroid resistance strains of malaria vectors which have been well characterized for understanding the molecular basis of resistance, especially fully susceptible laboratory-maintained strains as natural populations are no longer susceptible to pyrethroids., Two laboratory strains of An. funestus have been successfully established by the Vector Control Reference Laboratory at the National Institute for communicable diseases in South Africa. A pyrethroid-resistant An. funestus strain named FUMOZ was established from mosquitoes collected in southern Mozambique in 2000 (Hunt et al. 2005); this strain is also resistant to carbamates. The pyrethroid-susceptible strain FANG was established from An. funestus mosquitoes collected from southern Angola in 2002 and is fully susceptible to all insecticides. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) approaches demonstrated that pyrethroid resistance in FUMOZ was driven by several cytochrome P450 associated loci, among which one locus named resistance to pyrethroids (rp1) locus was predominantly driving resistance (Wondji et al. 2007, 2009). However, the genome-wide transcription profile associated with resistance specific to the FUMOZ lab strain has not been characterized. Such elucidation will help to identify potential drivers of a cross-resistance between pyrethroids and carbamates resistance. It could also help to establish a correlation between QTLs and transcription profile (Wondji et al. 2007, 2009). Furthermore, a full transcriptomic profiling of the FUMOZ-resistant strain will serve as a useful reference when screening novel insecticide candidates. Such a profile will help explain underlying molecular drivers of any observed cross-resistance, and thus help select novel insecticides and combinations thereof that minimize the risk of quick resistance development., Here, using an RNAseq-based transcription analysis, we characterized the gene expression profiles of two laboratory-adapted colonies of An. funestus: one selected for resistance to multiple insecticides and the other fully susceptible. This study has revealed a strong association between the over-expression of major resistance genes and the presence of signatures of selective sweep as the duplicated P450 genes CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b are massively over-expressed in FUMOZ while exhibiting a drastically reduced diversity compared to the susceptible FANG strain., Two An. funestus laboratory colonies were used in this study. The FANG colony is a fully insecticide susceptible colony derived from Angola (Hunt et al. 2005). The FUMOZ colony is a multi-insecticide resistant colony derived from southern Mozambique, with additional selection for insecticide resistance (Hunt et al. 2005). Colonies were maintained in insectaries at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine at 28°C, 80% humidity, and a 12 h light:dark cycle. Larvae were grown in mineral water in plastic trays and fed daily with ground TetraMin fish food. Adults were kept in 30 × 30 cm cages and provided with 10% sucrose. Adults were arm-fed to allow females to lay eggs., Total RNA was extracted from pools of 10 individual 3-day-old non-blood fed adult female mosquitoes using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). In this study, four pools of FUMOZ RNA were sequenced and one pool of FANG RNA, alongside three FANG RNAseq libraries from a previous study (Weedall et al. 2015). Methods used for RNA extraction, ribosomal RNA-depletion, library preparation, and sequencing were described previously (Weedall et al. 2015, 2019). Library preparation and sequencing were undertaken by the Centre for Genomic Research (CGR), University of Liverpool., Our analysis used the chromosome-scale An. funestus FUMOZ colony reference genome assembly AfunF3 and annotation gene set AfunF3.1 [downloaded from https://www.vectorbase.org/ (last accessed date: 11/10/2021) June 25, 2019 (Giraldo-Calderon et al. 2015)] (Ghurye et al. 2019, preprint). Gene set AfunF3.1 contains many putative genes with no functional descriptions. To aid interpretation of our results, all AfunF3.1 predicted transcripts were used for similarity-based functional annotation assignment using Blast2Go (Conesa et al. 2005) using the nonredundant (nr) protein database downloaded from NCBI. Blast (BLASTx) searches against the nonredundant (nr) protein database and InterProScan searches of the InterPro protein signature databases were carried out to further annotate the An. funestus protein-coding genes., De-multiplexed fastq files were trimmed to remove Illumina adapter sequences (minimum 3 bp match at the 3′ end) using Cutadapt version 1.2.1 (Martin 2011), and low-quality bases trimmed, using Sickle version 1.200 (Joshi and Fass 2011), with a minimum window quality score of 20. After trimming, reads shorter than 10 bp were removed. If both reads from a pair passed this filter, each was included in a forward or reverse reads file. If only one of a read pair passed this filter, it was place in an unpaired reads file., Strand NGS software, version 3.4 (Strand Life Sciences, Bangalore, India) was used for data analysis. Trimmed R1/R2 read pairs were aligned to the reference sequence (Afun 3.1) using the option ‘transcriptome and genome together’ (with novel splices) which aligns reads to both transcriptome and genome to find the best matches. Reads that remain unaligned after the first-round are then aligned by considering novel splices across known exons and/or novel candidate exons. A custom ‘build’ was generated for An. funestus genome in Strand NGS following the program’s instructions. The best matches for a read were reported if they satisfied the following criteria: a minimum percent identity of 90, a maximum percent gaps between matches of 5, a maximum number of novel splices of 2, a minimum match length of 25, a maximum number of matches to be reported for each read equal to 1, and ignoring reads with matches more than 5 matches. Further quality trimming was performed by removing 3′ ends with average base quality <10., Strand NGS was used to perform RNA quantification, which reports raw counts per gene by counting the total number of reads that map to each gene and exon in the An. funestus genome. Raw counts were normalized using DESeq’s inbuilt method (Anders and Huber 2010) which accounts for differences in the total number of reads between samples., Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) as implemented in Strand NGS. Two conditions (FUMOZ and FANG, each with four biological replicates) were contrasted. The estimated log2 fold-change (FC) for each gene was tested using a moderated t-test which is a modification of the unpaired t-test (Smyth 2004). P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach of Storey with bootstrapping (q-value). Differentially expressed genes were defined as those with an FDR-adjusted P-value <5% and FC ≥2., Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was carried out on differentially expressed gene sets using Strand NGS. A more detailed analysis was performed for detoxification genes of interest over-expressed in FUMOZ to detect sets of transcripts which are similarly expressed and thus potentially acting together in conferring resistance to FUMOZ. This was performed by selecting the list of transcripts significantly over-expressed in FUMOZ followed by the selection of the transcript of interest and then selecting the similarity metric with a minimum set at 0.5 using Strand NGS. Altogether, this option allows to find transcripts, in a specified list of transcripts (such as those upregulated), whose expression profile matches that of the transcript of interest., Strand NGS identifies differentially spliced genes based on change in transcript proportions across conditions which here is between FANG (susceptible) and FUMOZ (resistant). Here, a threshold of 0.25 was set to detect genes for which the transcript proportion varies between FUMOZ and FANG in which case the gene is termed differentially spliced. The process of determining transcript proportions takes reads which fall within the boundaries of a gene but outside the exon boundaries of any of the associated transcripts and ascribes these reads to an “unknown” transcript. Based on the fraction of reads that get ascribed to this “unknown” transcript, this “unknown” transcript gets a proportion much like any known transcript does. This proportion is checked for variation across conditions exactly as described above. If of all transcripts for the gene, it is the “unknown” transcript that shows the maximum change across conditions Strand NGS labels this gene as “novel”., RNAseq expression patterns of some of the most over-expressed detoxification genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), including CYP6P9a (AFUN015792), CYP6P9b (AFUN015889), GSTe2 (AFUN015809), CYP6P5 (AFUN015888), CYP325A (AFUN015966), and CYP6AA1 (AFUN015786). Total RNA was extracted from 3 batches of 10 mosquitoes for each strain using the picopure RNA extraction kit, as previously described (Riveron et al. 2013). The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly, 1 µg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT20 and RNase H according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The qRT-PCR amplification was performed following standard protocol (Kwiatkowska et al. 2013; Riveron et al. 2013) after establishing the standard curves for each gene to assess PCR efficiency and quantitative differences between samples using serial dilution. The relative expression of each gene was calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCT method (Schmittgen and Livak 2008) and compared between the two strains after normalization with the housekeeping genes ribosomal protein S7 (RSP7; AFUN007153) and actin 5C (AFUN006819)., The four FUMOZ and four FANG replicates were combined into a single sample to detect the relevant polymorphisms. All variant types [single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), and indels or MNPs] were detected by comparing against the FUMOZ genome using the MAQ independent model implemented in Strand NGS. Variant calling parameters thresholds were a phred-scaled confidence score cutoff of 50 or above. This score represents the confidence in the variant call. Other criteria include a coverage greater than 10, ignoring homopolymer of 10, or higher as well as the locations adjacent to them. A filtering step was performed as implemented in Strand NGS through the “HomPolyfilter” flag which removes indels calls with <25% supporting reads in homopolymer stretches and “IndelSR20” which removes indels with <20% of supporting reads. An SNP multi-sample report was generated which included the allele frequency in the population based on the number of supporting reads for each variant, the zygosity, genotype, score, and other attributes such as % of supporting reads and variants. For each variant, its SNP effect (nonsynonymous, synonymous, 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR etc.) and the affected transcripts were predicted using the gff3 transcript annotation (Afun3.1)., To detect SNPs significantly associated with pyrethroid resistance, we took two approaches. Firstly, we used a stringent differential allele frequency-based approach where a variant was considered significant in relation to pyrethroid resistance if the supporting read % range was 0–10% in all four FUMOZ samples, but 90–100% in all the four FANG samples. This is because the AFUN3.1 genome was generated from FUMOZ strain mosquitoes meaning resistance-conferring alleles are present in the reference sequence., The second approach assessed the significant association between each variant with permethrin resistance by estimating the unpaired t-test of each variant between both and the –Log10 of the resulting P-value used to generate a Manhattan plot for each chromosome. A cutoff of minimum of two samples for plotted SNPs was applied. Furthermore, analysis of the 2R chromosome region spanning the rp1 QTL was comparatively performed between both strains to detect signature of selection in the resistant FUMOZ strain. Briefly, the percentage of supporting reads at each variant was averaged between the four samples of each strain and plotted across the 120 kb region., Particular attention was given to the genes CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b which result from a fixed duplication of CYP6P9 in An. funestus compared to other Anopheles malaria vector species (Wondji et al. 2009). Polymorphisms in these genes were comparatively assessed between the two strains by focusing primarily on nonsynonymous SNPs. Each replicate was arbitrarily considered as an individual to facilitate the analysis. Data from the SNP multi-sample report were used to retrieve the polymorphisms observed in each sample and this information was transferred to the full length of each gene retrieved from Vectorbase. Bioedit was used to input various polymorphisms using an ambiguous letter to indicate heterozygote positions. Haplotype reconstruction and polymorphism analysis were performed in DnaSPv5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009), and MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018) was used to construct the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for each gene., A range of 43–65 million reads were obtained for each of the eight samples sequenced and successfully aligned to the An. funestus genome Afun 3.1 as illustrated by the quality metrics (Supplementary Table S2)., Seven hundred seventeen transcripts were over-expressed in FUMOZ and 1008 downregulated compared to FANG (Figure 1A). Analysis of the list of transcripts upregulated in FUMOZ revealed that among the most over-expressed with FC greater than 10 or more, the transcript with the highest FC at 83 is the AFUN019794 which is an Integrase catalytic domain-containing protein. This list of highly over-expressed genes in FUMOZ also contains the duplicated cytochrome P450s CYP6P9a (FC 82.23) and CYP6P9b (FC 11.15). Other genes belong to serine proteases and others are transposon-related genes (Supplementary Table S3)., Comparative transcription profiles of FUMOZ and FANG strains: (A) Volcano plot of differential gene expression between pyrethroid-resistant FUMOZ and susceptible FANG.

(D) Volcano plot showing the differential expression of alternative spliced genes highlighting the ABCA AFUN019220 as the single over-expressed and spliced gene in FUMOZ., Overall, the list of upregulated genes is dominated by genes belonging to several gene families associated with insecticide resistance including detoxification genes such as cytochrome P450s, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and carboxylesterases (Table 1; Supplementary Figure S1A). Among P450s, the duplicated CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b are by far the most over-expressed. The predominance of CYP6P9a/b is further evident by the fact that no other P450 gene has FC >6 and only three other P450s present expression of >3 notably CYP6P4a (FC 5.9), CYP325J1 (FC 4.9), and CYP4C36. The other P450s have low expression with FC <3 including CYP6M4, CYP6AA2, and CYP6P2 also on the 2R chromosome on the same cluster as CYP6P9a/b.,  List of most upregulated detoxification genes in FUMOZ strain, Description, gene annotation; FC, fold-change; FUMOZ/FANG reads, total read pairs across replicates; Log FC, log2 fold-change; P, FDR-adjusted P-value.,  List of most upregulated detoxification genes in FUMOZ strain, Description, gene annotation; FC, fold-change; FUMOZ/FANG reads, total read pairs across replicates; Log FC, log2 fold-change; P, FDR-adjusted P-value., Overexpressed GSTs include four genes from the epsilon class, all with moderate FCs notably GSTe2 (FC 3.3), GSTe3 (FC 3.6), GSTe5 (FC 2.5), and GSTe6 (FC 4.0). Other GSTs include GSTD3 (FC 3.1), GSTD1 (FC 2.4), and GSTT2 (FC 2.4). We also noted that a glutathione peroxidase also exhibits a high FC (FC 11.8) in FUMOZ although the overall number of reads was low (Table 1; Supplementary Figure S1B)., Three carboxylesterases are also over-expressed with AFUN016265 showing an FC of 7.2, an ortholog of AGAP001722 in An. gambiae, whereas the other two have FC <3 (AFUN16264 and AFUN000374, ortholog of AGAP006729 in An. gambiae)., Other detoxification genes over-expressed also have low FCs including an UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (AFUN004354; FC 2.1), a xanthine dehydrogenase (AFUN020670; FC 2.4), and four sulfotransferases (Table 1; Supplementary Figure S1C)., A group of transport-related genes are also over-expressed in FUMOZ among which the ABC transporter AFUN019220 (FC 4.7) and three solute carrier proteins and two sugar transporters with moderate FC (Table 1). Another set of genes over-expressed belong to mitochondrial redox group along with the ATP synthase subunit d (AFUN010502) is the most highly expressed (FC 8.2) as well as two glutaredoxins and thioredoxin peroxidase 4. A group of genes belonging to proteases are also over-expressed including trypsin, chymotrypsin, two carboxypeptidases Q [AFUN021240 (FC 17.8) and AFUN021239 (FC 11.5)], and arginosuccinate lyase (FC 2.7). Other genes families over-expressed include cuticular proteins, gustatory/odorant receptors genes, two microRNAs although with low number of reads (mir-279 and mir-33), and several transcription factors., Of the 1008 genes significantly downregulated in FUMOZ compared to FANG (Figure 1; Supplementary Table S4), the most downregulated gene is the Group XIIB secretory phospholipase A2-like protein with FC of −602.4. However, this list is dominated by several transcripts belonging to heat shock proteins including heat shock protein 70 A1 (AFUN019775), 70B2 (AFUN019570, AFUN019671, AFUN019513, AFUN019467, and AFUN019289). It also includes Thioredoxin peroxidase 4 (AFUN018693; FC 202.4) which is known to be required for the transcriptional responses to oxidative stress (Ross et al. 2000). Some detoxification genes were also downregulated in FUMOZ including cytochrome P450, GSTs, and carboxylesterases although none of these have been previously associated with resistance to insecticides (Supplementary Table S4)., The qRT-PCR performed with some candidate genes was concordant with the results observed with RNAseq with high expression of both CYP6P9a (FC 44.7) and CYP6P9b (FC 41.9), whereas the other genes had far lower expression level. These includes GSTe2, CYP6P5, CYP325A, and CYP6AA1 (Figure 1B)., The GO enrichment analysis of the list of 717 transcripts over-expressed in FUMOZ detected 28 enriched GO terms (Supplementary Figure S2A). There was a predominance of terms associated with peptidase activity including GO:0008233 for peptidase activity known to catalyze the hydrolysis of a peptide bond, GO:0004175 for endopeptidase activity known to catalyze the hydrolysis of internal, alpha-peptide bonds in a polypeptide chain, or GO:0008237 for metallopeptidase activity. Another group of GO terms was related to transport including GO:0005215 for transporter activity, GO:0055085 for transmembrane activity, or GO:0030001 for metal ion transport which is known to direct the movement of metal ions into or out of a cell or even between cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Other GO terms are associated with mitochondrial activity including GO:0005743 for mitochondrial inner membrane and GO:0019866 for organelle inner membrane. The other category of GO relates to hydrolase activity notably GO:0016787 known to catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds and GO:0017171 for serine hydrolase activity., Analysis of the GO enrichment from the list of downregulated transcripts provided a profile like that of upregulated genes (Supplementary Figure S2B) with similar groups of GO terms observed although with different % of enrichment., The entire list of detoxification genes was analyzed in detail to identify clusters of genes co-located on chromosomal regions of the genome. Analysis of the expression patterns of the entire P450 list revealed a peak of expression around CYP6P9a/b on 2R chromosome which is very similar in profile to the QTL peak previously detected in FUMOZ for the rp1 (resistance to permethrin-1) locus (Wondji et al. 2007, 2009) (Figure 1C). No other major peak was detected for P450s either on chromosome 3 or X (Supplementary Figure S3, A and B). No major peak was also observed for GSTs (Supplementary Figure S3C), ABC transporters (Supplementary Figure S3D), and carboxylesterases (Supplementary Figure S3E) with all transcripts exhibiting FC <5., Strand NGS identified 27 genes exhibiting differentially alternative spliced events between FUMOZ and FANG (Figure 1D;Supplementary Table S5). The gene with highest index of alternative splicing was AFUN021186 encoding for a DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 30 on chromosome 3 which is over-expressed in the susceptible FANG strain [splicing index (SI) = 0.77]. Among the genes upregulated in FUMOZ, the ABC transporter AFUN019220 had the highest splicing index (0.75). AFUN019220 has 7 exons and two isoforms (see https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/record/gene/AFUN019220; last accessed date: 11/10/2021) with exon 7 exhibiting alternative splicing in this experiment (Figure 2A). Analysis of the partition coverage across the 7 exons supports this difference at exon 7 between the two strains (Figure 2B). Gene-wide expression of this ABC gene is greater in the resistant FUMOZ strain (Violin plot, Figure 2C). A greater proportion of the isoform AFUN019220-RA (78.1%) is observed in the FUMOZ-resistant strain whereas a greater proportion of the other transcript AFUN019220-RB is seen in the susceptible strain (94.6%) (Figure 2D). The other detoxification gene of this list was the carboxylesterase AFUN000373 (SI = 0.33), whereas other genes do not have clear association with resistance mechanisms., Alternative splicing event at the over-expressed ABC transporter ABCA (AFUN019220).

(D) Differential expression of spliced transcripts AFUN019220-RA and -RB in FUMOZ and FANG., Analysis of the list of transcripts with similar expression to CYP6P9a detected 17 transcripts (Supplementary Table S6) with an expression similarity score >0.6 among which the only other detoxification gene was CYP6P9b P450 gene (score = 0.63). This could be explained by the very high expression of CYP6P9a which thus stands as an outlier compared to other detoxification genes., CYP6P9b in contrast to CYP6P9a had similar expression patterns to more genes (Supplementary Table S6). Among detoxification genes, the most similar gene being ABCA (AFUN019220) (SI = 0.77) followed by CYP6P4a P450. Other detox genes included the GSTs GSTe2 and GSTe6 and a carboxylesterase AFUN016265 (Supplementary Table S6). The list of entities with expression similar to GSTe2 was longer with the closest entity being a xanthine dehydrogenase (SI = 0.91) including six GSTs (with three GST epsilon and three GST Delta class), five P450s (CYP4C36, CYP9K1, CYP6N1, CYP6P2, and CYP9M1), three sulfotransferases, and a carboxylesterase (AFUN016264). The list of entity with expression similar to ABCA (AFUN019220) had GSTe2 as the closest (SI = 0.89) with six other GSTs found. It also has five P450 with CYP4C36 been the closest (Supplementary Table S6)., A total of 2,793,727 SNPs were detected between FUMOZ and FANG after comparison to the reference AFUN3.1 genome (from FUMOZ strain) and distributed across the three chromosomes from various variant types (Figure 3, A and B). The frequency-based filtering approach, considering only variant with supporting reads percentage between 0–10% for FUMOZ (close to reference genome) and 90–100% for FANG, detected 17,976 variants significantly different between the two strains across 3,599 genes. Of these, 1,596 were nonsynonymous variants and 6,354 synonymous and the remainder occur in 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR, and intron and intergenic regions. When a more stringent selection criteria of consistency in all four samples of each strain was applied, only 2,217 variants were detected including 254 nonsynonymous and 821 synonymous substitutions. A summary of differential SNPs predicted in detoxification genes is presented in Supplementary Table S7. Overall, analysis of SNPs located in detoxification genes highlighted a cluster of SNPs around the genomic region spanning the rp1 QTL on 2R chromosome belonging to highly over-expressed CYP450s, notably CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b (Supplementary Table S7). Other detoxification genes with significant SNPs belonging to cytochrome P450s located in rp1 included CYP6AA1, CYP6AA2, CYP6P4a, CYP6P1, and CYP6P2 (Supplementary Table S8). A second cluster of SNPs is associated with rp2 QTL on chromosome 2L including CYP6Z1, CYP6M7, CYP6Z3 all previously shown to be conferring pyrethroid resistance (Irving et al. 2012; Ibrahim et al. 2016). Another cluster of SNPs belong to P450s located on 3R chromosome spanning the previously described rp3 QTL including CYP9J5 (previously CYP9J11) shown to metabolize pyrethroids (Riveron et al. 2017) and CYP9J4 and CYP9J3. Notably, significant SNPs were also detected on chromosome X in CYP4G17 and CYP4G16. Interestingly, significant SNPs also belong to several ABC transporters including the alternatively spliced ABCA (AFUN019220). When looking more specifically at those significant nonsynonymous SNPs in the P450 genes, it was observed that they include a known asparagine to serine change at amino acid 384 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several hits were detected spanning the three chromosomes (Figure 3C). The genomic region with the highest P-value was in rp1 region on 2R chromosome. A detailed analysis showed that within this region the most significant SNPs corresponded to CYP6P9a gene (P = 4.53 × 10−22) with two other significant SNPs located in the same gene (Supplementary Table S9; Figure 3). Other highly significant variants were detected on chromosome 3 all in 3′ UTR regions of genes such as cytochrome b5 reductase (AFUN007146), CLIP-domain serine protease (AFUN022249), and an Ecdysone-induced protein 75B (AFUN020438) (Figure 3C). However, none of these genes were differentially expressed between the two strains. Two other SNPs were detected in chromosome X located in 5′ UTR of a cytochrome c oxidase (AFUN019973) and the other with no annotation (Supplementary Table S9; Figure 3C)., The reduced diversity observed around rp1 and the consistency of significant SNPs detected in CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b led us to further analyze the diversity of both genes (Figure 4A). Another P450 gene CYP4C36, upregulated in FUMOZ but at lower FC (3.0), was also analyzed in comparison to the CYP6P9a/b. Analysis of nonsynonymous substitutions of CYP6P9a revealed a drastic loss of diversity in FUMOZ with only a single polymorphism and two haplotypes vs 18 substitutions and eight haplotypes in FANG which was also reflected with lower genetic diversity π in FUMOZ (0.53) than in FANG (7) (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S10). A similar pattern was also observed for CYP6P9b (Figure 4C; Supplementary Table S10). By contrast, CYP4C36 did not show any difference between strains with similar estimates of genetic diversity for both and we therefore inferred that no selection at this locus (Figure 4D; Supplementary Table S10). Phylogenetic analysis of the three genes further supported this observation with FUMOZ samples clustering together alone for both CYP6P9a/b on just two haplotypes, whereas FANG is more diverse (Figure 4). Whereas for CYP4C36, samples from both strains are intermingled., Polymorphism patterns on the genomic regions spanning the rp1 QTL regions including CYP6P9a and b.

Here, we took advantage of two phenotypically contrasted laboratory colonies of the major malaria vector An. funestus to further decipher the underlying molecular basis of resistance to pyrethroids using RNAseq-based transcription analysis., The transcription profile of both lab strains correlates strongly to previous results obtained through QTL mapping using advanced inter-crossed lines from reciprocal crosses between FUMOZ and FANG (Wondji et al. 2007, 2009; Irving et al. 2012). Indeed, the most highly overexpressed detoxification gene from this analysis are the duplicated CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b cytochrome P450s with FCs far greater than other overexpressed genes, previously shown to drive resistance in this strain (Amenya et al. 2008; Wondji et al. 2009). This is in line with QTL mapping which detected three QTLs associated with pyrethroid resistance with the major one rp1, harboring CYP6P9a and b, explaining 86% of genetic variance of pyrethroid resistance (Wondji et al. 2009). This observation suggests that in a species such as An. funestus in which resistance to insecticides is mainly driven by metabolic resistance, combining RNAseq-based transcription analysis to QTL mapping provides a robust methodology for elucidating the molecular basis of resistance. Furthermore, the over-expression of other P450 genes on chromosome 2L and 3R correspond to two other QTL, rp2 and rp3 which were shown to be minor contributors well in line with the lower expression of these genes. The predominant role of CYP6P9a/b in FUMOZ also correlates with the high expression of these genes in wild populations across southern Africa (Riveron et al. 2013; Barnes et al. 2017a; Weedall et al. 2019). This suggests that the colonization of this strain in the laboratory has not significantly altered its genetic background in relation to resistance., Interestingly, in all three QTL regions, over-expression extends to multiple genes in the gene cluster including in rp1 where CYP6P4a, CYP6AA2, and CYP6P2 were also overexpressed. Such a pattern suggests a similar mechanism of transcriptional regulation applies to the cluster, rather than to an individual gene. While cis-regulation of transcription of individual genes likely plays a role (e.g., CYP6P9a and b in FUMOZ are much more over-expressed than are other genes in the cluster), other mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling (Clapier et al. 2017) around the gene cluster could allow transcriptional co-regulation of all of the genes. As could differential micro-RNA control of gene expression (Feng et al. 2018), which we observed for mir-33 and mir-279. Among upregulated P450s, those belonging to the CYP6 family were predominant as reported previously for insecticide-resistant mosquitoes (Djouaka et al. 2008; Riveron et al. 2018a), although not for Aedes aegypti where CYP9 genes are more abundantly over-expressed (Bariami et al. 2012; Ishak et al. 2017)., GST genes were also over-expressed, including GSTe2 and other epsilon class GSTs previously shown to metabolize permethrin, although the 119F resistant allele detected in West/central African populations is absent in FUMOZ (Riveron et al. 2013; 2017). Other members of this epsilon class such as GSTe4 and GSTe5 have been shown to confer pyrethroid resistance either in An. funestus (Kouamo et al. 2021) and An. gambiae (Wilding et al. 2015). Altogether, this evidence provides further support a key role for GST enzyme family in pyrethroid resistance., Besides cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and glutathione S-transferases, a number of genes from other detoxification-associated gene families were also overexpressed in FUMOZ as is often the cases for metabolic resistance (Puinean et al. 2010; Bariami et al. 2012; Riveron et al. 2013). These genes belonging to carboxylestases, sulfotransferases, UDP-glycosyltransferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporter warrant further study to assess their roles in metabolic insecticide resistance which has lagged behind cytochrome P450s. Both GO enrichment and detection of genes showing similar expression patterns indicate that these other genes probably act together with the primary genes as part of the same metabolic detoxification pathway., The upregulation of transposon-related genes in FUMOZ including the AFUN019794, (BEL12_AG transposon polyprotein; FC 83.2), is another feature of the differential expression between the two strains. We have previously reported that insertion of transposable elements is associated with the upregulation of detoxification genes in An. funestus (Weedall et al. 2020). Similar observations have been made in Drosophila melanogaster with the insertion the Accord transposable element into the 5′ end of the CYP6G1 gene which drives its over-expression (Daborn et al. 2002). Transposable element insertions are commonly associated with disruption of gene function (Bourque et al. 2018), but in the case of An. funestus, they probably facilitate resistance by introducing additional cis-regulatory elements. Differential suppression of transposable elements could control the frequency at which insertions occur (Bourque et al. 2018). In most contexts, weaker suppression would be deleterious, and we speculate here for future exploration, that such an extreme strategy could reflect the strength of selection imposed by insecticides on mosquitoes., Interestingly, a case of alternative splicing in the ABCA gene (AFUN019220) was strongly contrasted between strains suggesting a possible association with resistance as this gene has been shown to be over-expressed in pyrethroid-resistant populations Africa-wide (Weedall et al. 2019). Although this difference in isoform preference may also reflect the different geographic origins of the two strains, hence, further evidence is required to link this observation to insecticide resistance. A similar case of alternative splicing driving resistance to insecticide was reported in the tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta and shown to confer resistance to Spinosad insecticide through an exon skipping mechanism in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α6 subunit (Berger et al. 2016). The effect of differing alternative last exons (ALEs) in insects is poorly understood (Lee et al. 2021), however, in mice ALE choice directs subcellular localization of mRNAs (Taliaferro et al. 2016). Further work is needed to assess the association of the alternative splicing event at ABCA (AFUN019220) and pyrethroid resistance., Analysis of the genetic diversity patterns between both strains revealed striking differences with marked reduced diversity in FUMOZ in genomic regions spanning major resistance loci notably rp1 in the 2R chromosome. This result further supports the usefulness of RNAseq data to detect phenotypic signatures of selective sweep as the reduced diversity in FUMOZ using RNAseq correlates well with signatures previously detected with whole-genome sequencing in An. funestus (Barnes et al. 2017b; Weedall et al. 2020). The detection of the N384S mutation from CYP6P9b previously reported to drive an allelic variation conferring pyrethroid resistance to this species (Ibrahim et al. 2015) further shows the robustness of the frequency filtering approach used here in detecting phenotypically meaningful variants from RNAseq data. Analysis of the polymorphism patterns of major resistance genes CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b confirms that the reduced diversity in FUMOZ is likely associated with pyrethroid resistance since other genes such as CYP4C36 did not show the same difference in polymorphisms. Similar correlation between patterns of genetic diversity from RNAseq and genome sequencing has been reported recently in the almond agroecosystem (Calla et al. 2021)., One of the significant observations was the correlation between the reduced diversity around rp1 and the high over-expression of CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b supporting that metabolic resistance in An. funestus operates through both over-expression of detoxification genes but also through the selection of a highly metabolically active allele in line with the role of allelic variation shown previously for the duplicated CYP6P9a/b genes (Ibrahim et al. 2015). Similar correlation between over-expression and strong signatures of selective sweep have been reported before in An. funestus for other detoxification genes including GSTe2 (Riveron et al. 2014; Weedall et al. 2020), for CYP9K1 (Weedall et al. 2020), CYP6 cluster on 2R chromosome in An. gambiae as revealed by the 1000Ag genomes study (Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Consortium 2017), for the CYP6G1 in Drosophila (Schlenke and Begun 2004) or in the almond agroecosystem (Calla et al. 2021)., Not all significant SNPs in detoxification genes correlate with differential expression. For example, the CYP6Z1, CYP6M7, CYP6Z3 genes of the resistance to pyrethroid 2 (rp2) locus all previously shown to confer pyrethroid resistance (Irving et al. 2012; Ibrahim et al. 2016). These genes are particularly intriguing as the rp2 locus has not been predominant in resistant in natural populations across Africa, including samples from southern Africa sampled more recently than the FUMOZ strain (Weedall et al. 2019). Neither were the CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 P450 genes shown to be associated with cuticular resistance in An. gambiae (Balabanidou et al. 2016). Perhaps the most important role for these P450s is in the larval and pupal stage and we may have missed the peak of expression for these genes in our adult samples. Alternatively, as their expression is restricted to cuticular hydrocarbon secreting oenocytes (Balabanidou et al. 2016) any resistance-associated signal was swamped by our whole organism approach. As cuticular resistance is thought likely to confer cross-resistance by creating a barrier to insecticide permeability (Balabanidou et al. 2018), the variants identified here warrant further investigation., The comparative analysis of the transcription profiles of two phenotypically contrasted laboratory strains of the malaria vectors An. funestus has highlighted specific features associated with pyrethroid resistance. These include the predominance of cytochrome P450 genes in association with previous QTL studies; the strong association between over-expression and reduced diversity of major resistance genes; a potential role of alternative splicing from ABC transporter and the co-expression of several genes belonging to different families to confer resistance to mosquitoes. The detection of SNPs of interest and signatures of selective sweep and using RNAseq have also been achieved supporting the usefulness of this method beyond transcription profiling. This study will further facilitate future studies on the molecular basis of resistance in field populations of mosquitoes., RNAseq data submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive under PRJEB45224., Supplementary material is available at G3 online., The authors would like to thank Drs Jacob Riveron and Sulaiman Ibrahim for their insight into this study., This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowships in Biomedical Sciences (101893/Z/13/Z and 217188/Z/19/Z to C.S.W.) and Bill and Melinda Gates foundation Investment ID INV-006003 to C.S.W., C.S.W. conceived and designed the study.

Using these data, we have identified interesting candidate genes that may be critically important in aspects of adaptation to their food source that contains high concentrations of HA. Understanding how gene expression evolves during dietary specialization is crucial for our understanding of how ecological communities are built and how evolution shapes trophic interactions., Insects have long been recognized as one of the most abundant and diverse groups of organisms on the planet, with a large fraction of them feeding on plants (Jaenike 1990; Stork 2018). Many of these phytophagous insects have evolved to be highly host plant specific. The evolution of such specialized interactions is often guided by specific plant chemistry, with most plants responding to increased insect herbivory by the production of toxic secondary metabolites (Jaenike 1990; Petschenka and Agrawal 2016). This leads to an evolutionary arms race as insects evolve resistance to these toxins (Heidel-Fischer and Vogel 2015). While host plant-insect adaptions are well studied in the literature, less is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of these complex ecological interactions (Ungerer et al. 2008)., Drosophila sechellia feeds and oviposits primarily on Morinda citrifolia, a fruit highly toxic to other Drosophila species (Legal et al. 1992). The plant produces ripe fruit year-round in the Seychelles island archipelago, the sole location where D. sechellia are found (Legal et al. 1992) providing abundant and consistent resources. Upon exposure to the ripe fruit, other Drosophila species display frantic behavior and wing movements, reduction in locomotor activity, and death (Legal et al. 1994). Drosophila sechellia eggs are able to hatch and develop on M. citrifolia fruit but the embryos of other Drosophila species die (Amlou et al. 1998). Unlike its generalist sister species, D. sechellia prefer M. citrifolia to other hosts and are drawn to the fruit from a long distance (R’Kha et al. 1991). Drosophila sechellia evolved resistance to the toxins in M. citrifolia from an ancestral sensitive state (R'Kha et al., 1997) and this tolerance provides D. sechellia a temporal advantage over other fruit fly species that can only lay eggs in the fruit once it has rotten and the toxic volatiles are reduced., The toxic properties of Morinda are attributed to the carboxylic acids present in the pulp of the ripe fruit (Legal et al. 1994). This pulp is largely characterized by carboxylic acids, primarily the fatty acids octanoic (OA) and hexanoic acid, (HA) which comprise 58% and 19% of the volatile compounds found the ripe fruit respectively (Farine et al. 1996). While the genetic basis of D. sechellia resistance to the most abundant and toxic compound in M. citrifolia fruit, OA, has been characterized in previous studies (Dworkin and Jones 2009; Andrade Lopez et al. 2017; Lanno et al. 2017; Peyser et al. 2017; Lanno and Coolon 2019; Lanno et al. 2019a, 2019b), much less is known about the genes involved in HA resistance. In a study using fatty acid concentrations equivalent to 1.5 g of ripe M. citrifolia fruit, OA treatment alone killed all fruit fly species assayed except D. sechellia, while HA alone caused reversible knock-down in other Drosophilids (Farine et al. 1996). In a more recent study using higher concentrations of HA, mortality was observed in response to exposure to HA in D. melanogaster and D. simulans and D. sechellia is significantly more resistant to HA induced mortality than sister species (Peyser et al. 2017; Lanno and Coolon 2019). Surprisingly, tests of the three major detoxification gene families, cytochrome P450s (cyps), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and esterases (Ests) found that none was involved in derived HA resistance in D. sechellia suggesting an alternative genetic mechanism must be involved in resistance. Studies have suggested that HA may be a more efficient D. sechellia attractant than OA, while OA is a more potent repellant of generalist species (Amlou et al. 1998). In a test using laboratory food medium supplemented with 0.5% of either OA or HA, D. sechellia exhibited oviposition preference for media supplemented with HA over OA (Amlou et al. 1998)., From a study analyzing the transcriptomic response of D. sechellia on OA, 104 genes were found to be differentially expressed in response to OA (Lanno et al. 2017). This study showed that several Osiris genes, including Osi6 are upregulated in D. sechellia in response to OA. Another study showed that RNAi mediated knockdown of Osi6 expression drastically decreased survival in response to OA (Andrade Lopez et al. 2017). Given that HA makes up about of fifth of the volatile compounds found in M. citrifolia and produces unique effects on behavior (Farine et al. 1996) and has an unknown and less common basis for toxin resistance (Peyser et al. 2017; Lanno and Coolon 2019), identifying the genes responding to HA is necessary to understand how D. sechellia has specialized on M. citrifolia fruit, and may help pinpoint genes that are involved in resistance to HA. By also analyzing the genes responding to HA exposure in generalist Drosophila species D. melanogaster and D. simulans we can identify derived gene expression responses specific to D. sechellia that may be critical for HA associated traits (Coolon et al. 2009). In this study, adult female D. sechellia, D. melanogaster, and D. simulans flies were fed either control food or food supplemented with 0.23% HA and significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using RNA-seq. Comparison of the identified genes with those found to respond to OA (Lanno et al. 2017) and L-DOPA (Lanno et al. 2019), another highly abundant compound found in M. citrifolia fruit, identified several genes common in response to OA, HA, and L-DOPA as well as genes unique to HA suggesting these genes may play an important role in the evolved resistance and specialization of D. sechellia to M. citrifolia., Drosophila sechellia (14021-0428.25), D. simulans (14021-0251.195), and D. melanogaster (14021-0231.36) flies were reared on standard cornmeal medium under a 16:8 light: dark cycle maintained at 20°C., Zero to 3-day posteclosion adult female flies were fed control food (0.75 g Drosophila instant medium Formula 4-24, Carolina Biological Supply Company) or identical food containing 0.23% hexanoic acid (HA). After 24 h, three replicates of ten whole flies per species and per treatment were homogenized and total RNA was extracted with a modified protocol of the Promega SV extraction system (Coolon et al. 2013; Figure 1). RNA quality and quantity was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop spectrophotometry.

Bowtie2 was used for mapping reads to the appropriate reference genome for each species with default parameters (Langmead and Salzberg 2012), with the most recent genomes for each species available at the time of analysis acquired from Ensembl (www.ensembl.org, Yates et al., 2020) (D. sechellia: Drosophila_sechellia.dsec_caf1.dna.toplevel.fa, D. simulans: Drosophila_simulans.ASM75419v3.dna.toplevel.fa and D. melanogaster: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.dna.toplevel.fa). The Bowtie2 output files were analyzed using Cuffdiff (Trapnell et al. 2010), which performs gene expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis using the aforementioned genome file along with the most recent annotated .gff3 file for each genome available at the time of analysis acquired from Ensembl (D. sechellia: Drosophila_sechellia.dsec_caf1.42.gff3, D. simulans: Drosophila_simulans.ASM75419v3.42.gff3 and D. melanogaster: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.95.gff3). In Cuffdiff, geometric normalization and library size correction was performed, along with bias correction using the reference genome, giving an output of DEGs for each species following false discovery rate multiple testing correction (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995, q < 0.05). Data were visualized using R (R Core Development Team 2010). In order to compare gene expression results across species, we obtained all 1:1:1 orthologs from D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. melanogaster from Flybase (Thurmond et al. 2019). DEGs following D. sechellia exposure to OA or L-DOPA were downloaded from online databases (Lanno et al. 2017, 2019a). GO term enrichment was performed on D. melanogaster orthologs for each species using GeneOntology.org (www.geneontology.org, Ashburner et al. 2000; Mi et al. 2019; Carbon et al. 2021). KEGG pathway analysis was performed using the D. melanogaster ortholog for each DEG from each species (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway1.html, Kanehisa and Sato 2020)., In order to identify candidate genes that are important in D. sechellia host specialization and evolved resistance to HA, we sought genes that have altered expression levels in response to HA exposure. Previous studies have shown that such environmentally plastic gene regulation can indicate the importance of that gene’s function in that environment making identified genes good candidates for D. sechellia HA associated traits (Coolon et al. 2009; Lanno et al. 2017, 2019). To quantify gene expression response to HA we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on adult female flies after exposure to control food and compared this to flies fed food containing 0.23% HA. Because many of the transcriptional responses to HA might be nonspecific, we measured gene expression responses in D. sechellia, D. melanogaster, and D. simulans to identify those responses (or loss of response) that are restricted to D. sechellia representing changes that might contribute to its unique phenotypes., Using this approach, we identified 841 genes differentially expressed by D. melanogaster (Figure 2, A and D; Supplementary Table S1), 743 genes were differentially expressed by D. simulans (Figure 2, B and E; Supplementary Table S2) and only 93 genes were differentially expressed in D. sechellia (Figure 2, C and F; Supplementary Table S3) in response to HA. No significant difference in the number of upregulated genes (50/93) vs downregulated genes (43/93) was observed in D. sechellia in response to HA (Binomial Exact Test, P = 0.1066). In D. simulans, there was a significant difference in the number of upregulated genes (69/743) compared to the number of downregulated genes (674/743) in response to HA (Binomial Exact Test, P = 2.2e-16, Figure 2, B and E). In D. melanogaster, there was also a significant difference in the number of upregulated genes (171/841) compared to the number of downregulated genes (670/841) in response to HA (Binomial Exact Test, P = 2.2e-16, Figure 2, A and D). In D. sechellia, there were 39 DEGs identified that responded to HA that do not have annotated D. melanogaster orthologs. 27 of these genes were 5.8S rRNAs, two snoRNAs, and 7 genes of unknown function. Of the 27 5.8S rRNAs, all 27 were upregulated (Binomial Exact Test, P = 7.451e-09). In D. simulans, of the 743 DEGs there were annotated D. melanogaster orthologs for 673 genes. For the remainder of the analysis, only genes with known D. melanogaster orthologs are considered to allow functional interpretations of DEGs, and for all subsequent analyses the D. melanogaster ortholog name was used. This filtering resulted in 673 differentially genes in D. simulans, 841 in D. melanogaster and 54 in D. sechellia used in subsequent analyses., DEGs in adult D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. sechellia in response to HA.

Statistically significant genes are shown in red., To identify the biological pathways that are involved in responses to HA in D. sechellia, D. melanogaster, and D. simulans KEGG analyses of the upregulated and downregulated genes in each species were performed. These analyses show that many different metabolic and detoxification pathways along with proteins that localize to the lysosome are changing in response to HA exposure in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, whereas very few genes in these pathways are responding in D. sechellia (Figure 3, A and B). In D. sechellia, many of the genes downregulated in response to HA are involved in immune processes whereas this was much less prominent in D. melanogaster and D. simulans DEGs (Figure 3C)., KEGG and GO analysis of DEGs in response to HA.

In D. sechellia, GO term enrichment analysis of DEGs for cellular component showed a significant enrichment for extracellular region genes (P = 4.83e-05), suggesting that several of the genes responding to HA exposure have proteins that are secreted. For biological process GO term enrichment analysis, processes involved in the antibacterial humoral response were significantly enriched (P = 1.75e-08). In D. sechellia, no molecular function processes were significantly enriched. In D. melanogaster, there was also significant enrichment for GO terms for extracellular region genes (P = 4.42e-04), along with genes found inside the nucleolus (P = 8.40e-04). For biological process, GO terms associated with genes involved in the antibacterial humoral response were significantly enriched as in D. sechellia (P = 3.02e-02), as were other terms involved in the Drosophila immunity. The D. melanogaster HA response also was enriched for genes involved in ribosome biogenesis (P = 3.66e-02). In D. simulans, genes found inside the nucleolus were significantly enriched in the set of HA responsive genes (P = 2.65e-02). In an analysis of DEGs in D. simulans that are upregulated, genes involved in Notch signaling were significantly enriched (P = 4.11e-04) alongside genes involved in vitelline membrane and chorion formation (P = 2.56e-02). In D. sechellia, upregulated genes were significantly enriched for the larval serum protein complex (P = 1.96e-02). Downregulated genes were significantly enriched with antibacterial humoral response GO terms (P = 3.24e-10) along with the response to hyperoxia (P = 1.52e-03). These downregulated genes were also enriched for the extracellular region (P = 4.17e-05). In D. melanogaster, upregulated genes were significantly enriched to be involved in the larval serum protein complex (P = 1.23e-03) and were enriched intracellularly (P = 4.02e-16) and within intracellular organelles (1.32e-13). These upregulated genes were significantly enriched in many biological processes, including chromatin silencing (P = 3.25e-03), ecdysone receptor-mediated signaling (P = 1.89e-02), and chorion assembly (P = 2.25e-02). In D. melanogaster, downregulated genes were significantly enriched for the antibacterial humoral response (P = 4.52e-03) and for the defense response to Gram-positive bacteria (P = 5.07e-04). These downregulated genes were significantly enriched to be localized to the extracellular region (P = 1.25e-04)., In order to identify genes with D. sechellia specific responses to HA, we compared the DEGs from the three species when exposed to HA (Figure 4A). We identified 33 genes that were differentially expressed by D. sechellia flies exposed to HA that were not responsive to HA exposure in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans flies (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table S13). Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed for the 33 DEGs that are unique to the response to HA in D. sechellia and the downregulated DEGs are significantly enriched for immune response GO terms and response to stress (GO:0006950, Supplementary Table S23). There is no significant enrichment of unique upregulated DEGs in D. sechellia. In order to identify those genes where D. sechellia specific loss of response to HA was observed we selected those genes with significant changes in response to HA in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans that were not significantly differentially expressed by D. sechellia in response to HA. This analysis yields a total of 213 genes with this expression pattern in our data (Supplementary Table S10). Of these 213 DEGs shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, 205 of these genes are downregulated in both species in response to HA (Supplementary Table S10). GO analysis of these DEGs shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans gives no significant enrichment. There are only 4 DEGs unique to D. melanogaster and D. simulans that are upregulated in both species (CG11835, Cpr62Bc, cype, and RpL6). Interestingly, only 2 genes were identified, CG13114 and Fbp1, that had significant response to HA in all three species, with the expression of both increasing in D. simulans and decreasing in D. sechellia and D. melanogaster (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table S9)., DEG overlap between species and treatments.

Overlap and species-specific number of DEGs are indicated. (B) The number of differentially expressed genes in D. sechellia when it is exposed to OA, HA, or L-DOPA treatment as well as the number of specific and overlapping genes are shown., To assess the overlap in transcriptional responses of D. sechellia to both OA and HA, the predominant fatty acid volatiles in M. citrifolia, along with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which is found in M. citrifolia fruit and is important for the specialization of D. sechellia to this fruit (Lavista-Llanos et al. 2014; Lanno et al. 2019a), we compared DEGs between our HA treatment, DEGs identified in a previous study using a 0.7% OA treatment (Lanno et al. 2017), and DEGs identified in a previous study of responses to 10 mg/mL of L-DOPA added to the fly food (Lanno et al. 2019a). Treatment with OA treatment yielded 103 D. sechellia genes with D. melanogaster orthologs that were significantly differentially expressed. Treatment with L-DOPA yielded 643 D. sechellia genes with D. melanogaster orthologs that were significantly differentially expressed. Comparison of genes responsive to HA, OA, and L-DOPA identified 12 DEGs that respond to HA, OA, and L-DOPA treatment in D. sechellia (Figure 4B, Supplementary Table S6). Interestingly, of the 19 shared DEGs with D. melanogaster orthologs between OA and HA treatments, all genes are downregulated except for E(spl)mgamma-HLH, which is upregulated upon both OA and HA treatment (Supplementary Table S4). To compare metabolic and cellular pathways involved in the conserved response between OA and HA treatment in D. sechellia, GO term enrichment analysis was performed on shared DEGs. Genes involved with biological processes related to the humoral immune response were overrepresented (P = 2.95e-08, Supplementary Table S22). No significantly enriched processes were found for molecular function or cellular component. A KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in D. sechellia similarly found that upon OA, D. sechellia downregulated genes involved in both the Toll and Imd signaling pathways as well as genes involved in metabolic processes (Supplementary Table S21 and Figure S1). Interestingly, in response to OA and HA, D. sechellia downregulated genes involved the humoral immune response (AttC, CecA2, Def, DptB, Dro, edin, and PGRP-SB1 Supplementary Table S4)., Understanding the genetic basis of how organisms evolve to occupy different ecological niches and adapt to their environments is crucial to understanding the evolution of plant and animal interactions. Insect-host plant specialization is an excellent example of the evolution of such interactions and has been the subject of numerous ecological studies. While the phenomenon is well documented, the genetic basis of evolved host specialization is still not widely understood. Here, we focus on the specialization of D. sechellia to feed almost exclusively on one host plant, M. citrifolia because it is an excellent model to understand the genetic basis of dietary specialization. This is in part because it is has evolved recently and very closely related to the genetic model generalist species D. melanogaster. Fortuitously, we can take advantage of the wealth of genetic tools and information about D. melanogaster and sister species to understand the evolution of dietary specialization in this group (Groen and Whiteman 2016)., Drosophila sechellia upregulates a single cytochrome P450 (Cyp4e1) in response to HA whereas D. simulans downregulates this same gene (Supplementary Table S2), but previous work has shown that cytochrome P450s are not the evolved mechanism by which D. sechellia is able to survive OA or HA exposure (Peyser et al. 2017). Previous work has shown that HA induces a “reversable coma” in generalist D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana flies (Farine et al. 1996), and D. sechellia prefers to oviposit on HA compared to OA and control food sources (Amlou et al. 1998). Drosophila sechellia has a premature stop codon in Obp56e as well as Obp57d and Obp57e alleles that reduce their avoidance to noni volatiles (Matsuo et al. 2007; Dworkin and Jones 2009). The mechanisms that drive this attraction may be through changes in gene expression and may be reflected in these predicted regulatory networks. Drosophila sechellia downregulates many genes involved in the immune response when exposed to both HA and OA, suggesting that somehow these two medium-chain fatty acids are interacting with negative effectors of Imd or Toll signaling. As these two immune pathways have similar and overlapping target genes, further analysis is needed to determine which immune pathways are involved in these interactions (Hanson and Lemaitre 2020). This interaction between D. sechellia and the volatiles from M. citrifolia reduces the immune response, which could cause alterations in gut microbiota composition that aids in the detoxification of relevant plant secondary metabolites. E(spl)mgamma-HLH is a Notch responsive Myc-like transcription factor that has been shown to interact with Relish, the main regulator of Imd immune signaling (Dushay et al. 1996) through recent yeast two-hybrid assays (Shokri et al. 2019) and is upregulated in D. sechellia in response to both OA and HA exposure (Figure 4B, Supplementary Table S4). The plastic response of insect immune systems allows them to fend off pathogens when needed, but also allow for the management of endosymbionts (Login et al. 2011; Vilcinskas 2013). Unlike its generalist sister species, Drosophila sechellia was previously shown to lack an immune response when confronted with parasitic wasps, hinting that immune system responses in this species may be unlike its generalist sister species (Salazar-Jaramillo et al. 2017). In addition, prior work showed that free fatty acids are involved in regulating immune responses in mammals (Alvarez-Curto and Milligan 2016), and hexanoic acid priming of plants can activate the jasmonic acid pathway to increase plant resistance to fungal pathogens (García-Robles et al. 2013; Aranega-Bou et al. 2014). Using functional studies to alter the expression of known immune effectors and test if this alters resistance or preference for noni volatiles would be useful in understanding the interaction between immunity and these chemicals. Likewise, further study comparing the microbiomes between D. sechellia and D. simulans and how they may change from feeding on M. citrifolia fruit as well as how each responds to pathogen challenge in this context would help to understand why D. sechellia is downregulating its immune response when there could be a serious fitness cost of this action., Recent studies have shown that D. melanogaster uses sweet-tasting gustatory receptor neurons to sense OA and HA (Masek and Keene 2013; Chen and Amrein 2017; Tauber et al. 2017). Our data show that upon exposure to HA, only D. sechellia significantly upregulates another odorant-binding protein, Obp56a. In contrast to HA treatment, in response to OA D. sechellia adults do not change expression of any odorant-binding proteins (Lanno et al. 2017). Both D. simulans and D. melanogaster downregulate the expression of Opb57a in response to HA (Supplementary Table S10), and D. sechellia upregulates the expression of Obp56a in response to HA (Supplementary Table S13). Recently, studies examining the gustatory and behavioral basis of the attraction of D. sechellia to noni have shown that Or22a neurons in the fly brain are involved in the attraction to noni (Auer et al. 2020), as are Or85b/c and Ir75b neurons (Prieto-Godino et al., 2017). Orco mutant D. sechellia flies lose olfactory responses to both 2-heptanone and 1-hexanol, two compounds found in ripe noni fruit (Auer et al. 2020). Further work on the role of these genes in D. sechellia and the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the change of odorant-binding protein expression in response to HA may help to elucidate how D. sechellia has evolved to specialize on M. citrifolia., Drosophila sechellia is altering the expression of far fewer genes in response to HA than in the generalist species D. melanogaster and D. simulans (Supplementary Tables S1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S3). Drosophila sechellia appears to be downregulating many genes involved in the immune response whereas D. melanogaster and D. simulans alter the expression of genes involved in many different metabolic pathways (Figure 4, A–C). As generalist insects feed on many different plants which produce different secondary metabolites to defend themselves from predators, perhaps generalist species have a more plastic regulatory response to subvert toxicity whereas the specialist D. sechellia is resistant to the toxicity of its host through a specific constitutive mechanism. A recent study comparing the fitness of D. melanogaster to D. sechellia larvae fed different food sources showed a loss of carbohydrate metabolic responses in D. sechellia, as they have specialized on a fruit with a relatively low sugar content, M. citrifolia (Watanabe et al. 2019). Of the many significant genes differentially expressed in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, most DEGs are not drastically differentially expressed in HA treatment compared to controls (Figure 2, D and E). Drosophila sechellia conversely alters the expression of relatively far fewer genes, but many of the DEGs in response to HA are drastically differentially expressed (Figure 2F). Similarly, another study found that when adapted to a grass diet, Spodoptera littoralis had a smaller transcriptional response when fed maize compared to more generalist S. littoralis (Roy et al. 2016). Determining the scale of these responsive regulatory effects and their role in toxin resistance will help elucidate how D. sechellia has evolved to avoid the toxicity of M. citrifolia., In response to OA, D. sechellia increases its expression of several Osiris genes (Lanno et al. 2017). Previous work using RNAi in D. melanogaster to knock-down the expression of individual genes and examine survival in these flies when exposed to OA showed that the reduction of Osi6, Osi7, and Osi8 expression decreased survival (Andrade Lopez et al. 2017). In response to HA, neither D. sechellia nor D. melanogaster significantly alter the expression of any Osiris genes, but D. simulans downregulates the expression of Osi6, Osi7, and Osi15 (Supplementary Table S2). The cellular and physiological function of these genes is unknown, so understanding what these genes are doing and how they may be helping to shape the interactions between these insects and their toxic hosts will be useful to better understand how these interactions evolve (Coolon et al. 2019)., Examining and comparing the changes in transcriptional output of insects when exposed to these different plant chemicals in specialized vs generalist species provides a framework to understand how these interactions have evolved. Pathway analyses of these genes are useful in determining the physiological function of altered expression in response to these chemicals, but functional analyses of transcription factors that alter expression of these genes are necessary to better understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in the dietary specialization. Comparing transcription factors responding to plant chemicals may help elucidate regulatory mechanisms involved in these responses and shed light on how insects use changes in the transcription of target genes in order to compete against plants in this evolutionary arms race to adapt to toxic food sources., All RNA-seq data generated in this manuscript have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE185176.

Finally, we discuss hypothesized mechanisms underlying our observations of heterochiasmy and crossover suppression and discuss the broader implications for plant breeding., Meiotic recombination plays essential roles in evolution and breeding by creating new combinations of existing alleles, which generates genomic diversity that can be selected upon in a population (Barton and Charlesworth 1998). In the context of meiosis, crossing over aids in homology recognition and ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes to prevent aneuploidy (Moore and Orr-Weaver 1997). Recombination also serves as an important breeding tool, as its rate dictates the resolving power of quantitative trait mapping, the precision of allele introgression, and ultimately the ability to combine favorable alleles in the same haplotype for generating improved varieties (Mercier et al. 2015)., While recombination rates can vary among and within taxa, the variation appears to be tightly constrained by both an upper and lower bound (Ritz et al. 2017). In most species, there is one obligatory crossover per tetrad to prevent aneuploidy, which explains the lower bound (Wang et al. 2015). The reasons for an upper bound on crossover number, however, are less obvious. One plausible explanation is that limiting crossovers confers an evolutionary advantage by preserving favorable combinations of alleles residing on the same haplotype (Ritz et al. 2017)., The distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is not random and is influenced by chromosome features such as chromatin structure, gene density, and nucleotide composition (Dluzewska et al. 2018). The occurrence of a crossover at one location also reduces the likelihood that another crossover will occur in close proximity (Sturtevant 1915; Mercier et al. 2015). This nonrandom placement of crossovers, known as crossover interference, results in a pattern where recombination events appear more evenly spaced than would be expected by random chance (Foss et al. 1993). Interference may serve as a biological mechanism to ensure that every pair of homologous chromosomes undergoes at least one crossover event, which is necessary for proper disjunction (Otto and Payseur 2019)., In many species, crossover frequency and distribution along chromosomes differs between female and male meiosis, a phenomenon referred to as heterochiasmy (Lenormand and Dutheil 2005). The direction and degree of these differences are typically species-specific. The most extreme are cases in which one of the two sexes lacks meiotic recombination entirely; for example, male Drosophila melanogaster does not recombine during meiosis (Morgan 1910). In plants, the ratio of male to female recombination has been found to vary from 0.6 to 1.3 (Lenormand and Dutheil 2005). In wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana, male recombination is higher than female recombination, while the opposite was recently found in mutant lines with increased recombination (Fernandes et al. 2018). In a plant breeding context, heterochiasmy leads to an altered probability of generating a favorable recombination depending on the direction of a cross., To date, recombination landscapes have not yet been well-characterized in cassava (Manihot esculenta). Cassava is a root crop cultivated in the tropics, a staple carbohydrate-rich food for hundreds of millions of people and a particularly important food security resource for small-holder farmers (http://faostat.fao.org). Recent genomic selection efforts have generated a large amount of genomic data, which also makes cassava a useful model for other tubers and clonally propagated crops (Ceballos et al. 2012; Wolfe et al. 2017). Cassava is a diploid organism with an estimated genome size of approximately 772 Mb spread across 18 chromosomes (Awoleye et al. 1994), with the reference genome spanning 582.28 Mb (Bredeson et al. 2016). The International Cassava Genetic Map Consortium (ICGMC) generated a consensus genetic map of cassava that combines 10 mapping populations, consisted of one self-pollinated cross and nine biparental crosses (14 parents total; 3480 meioses; ICGMC 2015). The genetic map is 2412 cM in length and organizes 22,403 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers., An important feature of the cassava genome in some populations is the presence of two large introgressions from the wild relative Manihot glaziovii. In the 1930s, breeders crossed cassava with M. glaziovii to incorporate cassava mosaic disease resistance, and these hybrids were key founders of breeding germplasm (Hahn et al. 1980; Wolfe et al. 2019). Wolfe et al. (2019) detected large M. glaziovii introgressions prevalent in African cassava populations on chromosome 1, spanning from 25 Mb to the end of the chromosome, and on chromosome 4 from 5 to 25 Mb. M. glaziovii and M. esculenta diverged approximately 2–3 million years ago, and have 2.2% homozygous differences at genotyped positions (Bredeson et al. 2016). The M. glaziovii introgressions are thought to contribute both beneficial alleles and deleterious load, are associated with strong linkage disequilibrium, and have been increasing in frequency although maintained in the heterozygous state in the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) genomic selection program (Wolfe et al. 2019). Therefore, further investigation into the effect of M. glaziovii introgressions on recombination is needed to understand the implications of the introgression for cassava breeding., Here, we demonstrate the application of SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM (O’Connell et al. 2014) to detect crossover events and characterize recombination landscapes across the cassava genome. Using a multigenerational cassava breeding pedigree and associated GBS data from the IITA, we identified and validated informative parent-offspring duos and trios, phased parental haplotypes, and inferred recombination events between SNP intervals. In this context, we use both the terms “recombination” and “crossover” to refer to meiotic crossovers inferred from patterns of switched parental haplotypes observed in the progeny, though we note that not all crossovers result in a detectable exchange of polymorphisms, and that recombination can also occur due to homologous repair or gene conversion. We used the inferred crossovers to construct new genetic maps and compared them to the existing ICGMC composite map. We then examined crossover frequency and distribution across the genome with respect to sex and M. glaziovii introgression status. Finally, we discuss the implications of our observations for plant breeding., This study analyzed germplasm from the genomic selection program at IITA from 2012 to 2015 as part of the Next Generation Cassava Breeding Project (“NextGen”; nextgencassava.org). The IITA pedigree consists of 7432 unique individuals from four breeding populations, originating from the genetic gain (GG) collection previously described in Okechukwu and Dixon (2008): GG (n = 494), TMS13 (n = 2334), TMS14 (n = 2515), or TMS15 (n = 2089). Of the 494 GG individuals, 236 individuals are founders and the remaining 258 are the progeny of within-population GG×GG crosses. TMS13, TMS14, and TMS15 successively originated from crosses among and between the previous populations as illustrated in Figure 1. The selection of parents used to generate each population are described in Wolfe et al. (2017)., Diagram of the IITA pedigree structure. Population size and ancestry of the four breeding populations in the IITA pedigree. Arrows represent parentage relationships, where a pair of adjacent arrows represent two parents used in a cross., Diagram of the IITA pedigree structure. Population size and ancestry of the four breeding populations in the IITA pedigree. Arrows represent parentage relationships, where a pair of adjacent arrows represent two parents used in a cross., The breeding populations were genotyped with GBS as described in Wolfe et al. (2017). GBS data consisting of 22,403 markers with an average depth of 7x was available through NextGen for 7294 of the 7432 individuals (nGG = 366, nTMS13 = 2330, nTMS14 = 2509, and nTMS15 = 2089). Filters were applied to remove sites with more than 70% missing data, individuals with more than 80% missing data, and sites with a mean depth across all samples greater than 120 to avoid spurious genotype calls within repeat regions., Some accessions in the population had more than one GBS record due to multiple sequencing events. Before merging the data, the R package BIGRED was used to verify the identity of putative technical replicates. BIGRED uses a Bayesian model to infer which of the samples originated from an identical genotypic source, as described in Chan et al. (2018). Putative replicates with unambiguous BIGRED results were inferred to be true replicates and were merged. Those for which BIGRED returned a source vector with no clear majority were ambiguous, so the samples were excluded from future analyses. Table 1 summarizes the number of individuals in each group with more than one GBS record that could be validated as replicates with BIGRED., Summary of GBS data records for each breeding group, The number of individuals with available GBS data in each breeding group. Of those with multiple GBS records, replicates that could not be unambiguously verified as identical with BIGRED were excluded from analysis., Summary of GBS data records for each breeding group, The number of individuals with available GBS data in each breeding group. Of those with multiple GBS records, replicates that could not be unambiguously verified as identical with BIGRED were excluded from analysis., To validate pedigree information, the parentage assignment algorithm AlphaAssign was used to infer parents from GBS data. As described in Whalen et al. (2018), AlphaAssign uses the genotypes of a target individual and a known parent (if available) to calculate the posterior probability distribution of expected genotypes for its relatives and classify candidate individuals as one of four possible relationships: parent, full-sibling of a parent, half-sibling of a parent, or unrelated to the target individual. The list of candidate parents for each breeding group was based on the generation of that population as described above. For example, for TMS14 target individuals, GG and TMS13 individuals were listed as candidate parents. Founders were excluded as target individuals. To simplify the computations and to filter for sites in linkage disequilibrium, allelic depth data from 1000 sites were sampled randomly across the 18 chromosomes such that no two sites fell within 20 kb from one another. The choice of this site count was based on the simulations of Whalen et al. (2018) which found this number of markers to be sufficient for accurate parentage assignment at 5x coverage., Since AlphaAssign evaluates pairwise relationships, the validation procedure was carried out twice to infer both parents of individuals in the pedigree. In the first run, no prior pedigree information was given to the algorithm such that all calculations involved the use of a “dummy parent” with genotype probabilities calculated using estimated allele frequencies and assuming Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE; Whalen et al. 2018). For each target individual, the candidate individual with the highest score statistic was listed as the parent in an inferred pedigree. Inferred parents were then input as prior known parents for a second run to identify the other parent. The AlphaAssign-inferred pedigree was then compared with IITA’s existing pedigree to validate the listed parents. The 5479 individuals with one or both listed parents successfully validated by AlphaAssign were considered useable as duos or trios for further analysis. Table 2 summarizes the number of individuals with validated parents from each breeding group., Summary of pedigree validation using AlphaAssign, Summary of the number of individuals with validated parents across the four breeding groups. An individual’s data are labeled “missing” when GBS sequence data were not available for that individual or when replicates could not be resolved with BIGRED., Summary of pedigree validation using AlphaAssign, Summary of the number of individuals with validated parents across the four breeding groups. An individual’s data are labeled “missing” when GBS sequence data were not available for that individual or when replicates could not be resolved with BIGRED., The posterior probabilities for the three genotypes were estimated using the likelihoods defined above with a genotype prior. The genotype prior for each individual d was calculated based on the posterior probability genotype distributions of its known parents, following rules of Mendelian inheritance. If individual d had only one validated parent or was a founder with no validated parents, its genotype prior for site v was calculated using the estimated frequency of the reference allele at site v in the population and assuming HWE. Genotypes were called for individual d at site v only if one of the three possible genotypes had a posterior probability greater than or equal to 0.99. We note this method requires calculation of posterior genotype probabilities in a sequential manner, propagating information down the pedigree to subsequent generations., The dataset was then filtered to remove monomorphic and singleton sites, and sites with more than 30% missing data. The 30% missingness threshold was selected as a compromise between the power to detect crossovers amid noise of poor-quality markers and the resolution affected by the number of markers retained in the dataset. Supplementary Table S1 lists the number of sites retained after applying the filters, ranging from 1114 to 3739 SNPs per chromosome, for a total of 35,127 SNPs across the genome., The softwares SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al. 2013) and duoHMM were used to phase and impute genotypes, correct switch errors (SEs), and detect intervals surrounding inferred recombination events, following the methods of O’Connell et al. (2014). First, phased haplotypes were inferred with SHAPEIT2 without explicit family information, and then the verified pedigrees were used to correct SEs using duoHMM. The duoHMM Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is described in detail in O’Connell et al. (2014). Briefly, duoHMM infers the true inheritance states from the observed, imperfect parental, and progeny haplotypes. After estimating parameters of the HMM using the Forward Backward algorithm, duoHMM finds the most likely state sequence using the Viterbi algorithm. When duoHMM infers a SE in the Viterbi sequence in either the parent or child, it corrects the haplotypes by switching the phase of all loci following the SE. The algorithm applies these corrections sequentially down through each pedigree., These steps were carried out internally within SHAPEIT2 by using the “—duohmm” flag. The set of genotypes, verified pedigree information, and a genetic map generated by interpolating genetic distances for the locations of our GBS markers using ICGMC’s composite genetic map were input to produce a haplotype graph encapsulating uncertainty about the underlying haplotypes. SHAPEIT2 was run with 14 burn-in iterations, 16 pruning iterations, and 40 main iterations, with 200 conditioning states per SNP. A window size of 5 Mb was used, based on the developers’ finding that it was advantageous to use a window size larger than 2 Mb when large amounts of identical by descent (IBD) sharing are present (O’Connell et al. 2014). The effective population size was set at its default value of 15,000., After correcting SEs in the SHAPEIT2-inferred haplotypes, duoHMM was run again to infer recombination events. DuoHMM samples a haplotype pair for each individual from SHAPEIT2’s diploid graph and then calculates the probability of a recombination event between markers (O’Connell et al. 2014). The inter-SNP recombination probabilities were averaged across 10 iterations. A crossover interval was included in subsequent analyses if the interval had an average probability greater than or equal to t = 0.5, corresponding to a detection rate of 90.57% and a false discovery rate of 2.89% reported by the developers in simulations with realistic levels of genotyping error (O’Connell et al. 2014). Supplementary Figure S1 shows the duoHMM-inferred crossover intervals passing the t = 0.5 significance threshold for each chromosome., The power to detect recombination events depends on the structure of the pedigree, with most recombination events detectable in a nuclear family with more than two offspring (O’Connell et al. 2014). Therefore, those pedigrees consisting of a family with three generations or with more than two offspring were classified as informative toward recombination and were selected for analysis. We refer to the parents of these pedigrees as “informative parents” and the meioses in these pedigrees as “informative meiosis.” Of the total 8678 meioses in the dataset, 7020 were informative., To examine if crossover placements are random and independent events, the deviance goodness of fit test was used to test whether the distribution of crossovers followed the expected Poisson distribution (Foss et al. 1993; Otto and Payseur 2019). For each chromosome, a Poisson regression was used to model the number of crossovers observed in a given parent-offspring pair as a function of the covariates “parent” and “parental sex,” specifying whether the crossovers were observed in a male or female meiosis. The residual deviance of the regression was used to conduct a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for the model at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of α/m, where α = 0.05 and m = 18 (the number of chromosomes tested)., To build a genetic map for each chromosome, the genetic length of each SNP interval was calculated using the number of recombination events observed in each interval. If a crossover interval spanned multiple SNP intervals, a fraction of the crossover event was assigned to each of the spanned intervals, calculated as 1/(length of the SNP interval). The genetic length of each SNP interval on chromosome y was calculated by dividing the number of crossovers in each interval by a scaling factor ny, where ny = (the genetic length of chromosome y in the ICGMC map)/(the total number of crossovers detected on chromosome y), such that the genetic length of each chromosome would be the same as the ICGMC map., To determine whether the distribution of crossover events along each chromosome varied between the sexes, the number of male meiotic crossovers and female meiotic crossovers were compared in 1 Mb windows with a chi-square test in each window. To calculate the expected number of male and female crossovers in a given window, the proportions of informative meioses that were male (0.487) and female (0.514) were multiplied by the total number of crossovers observed in the window. The last window of each chromosome was excluded since it was shorter than 1 Mb. Four of the 510 windows had one or more classes with an expected frequency count of less than five and so were excluded. Each window was tested at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of α/N, where α = 0.05 and N = 506 (the total number of windows tested). A chi-square test was also conducted genome-wide at a significance level of α = 0.05. All chi-square tests were conducted with the chisq.test() function in R., We note that because the dataset contains multiple meioses observed for a single individual, and multiple crossovers counted from each meiosis, the independence assumption of the chi-square test is not perfectly met. However, we expect that this has minimal effect on the interpretation of these tests, due to the size of the population and the magnitude of the observed effect size. In addition, the precedence for the use of chi-square tests for testing heterochiasmy with crossover counts is established in the literature (Drouaud et al. 2007; Kianian et al. 2018; Capilla-Pérez et al. 2021)., To examine recombination patterns in the M. glaziovii introgression regions on chromosomes 1 and 4, the introgression status of informative parents was first classified based on data described in Wolfe et al. (2019). Briefly, a set of introgression diagnostic markers (IDMs) across the cassava genome were identified by comparing a panel of nonadmixed M. glaziovii individuals with a panel of nonadmixed M. esculenta individuals. An IDM was defined as an SNP that is either (1) fixed for different alleles between the M. glaziovii and M. esculenta reference panels or (2) fixed among M. esculenta samples but polymorphic in the M. glaziovii panel. Wolfe et al. calculated the mean M. glaziovii allele dosage at IDMs within 250-kb windows for each individual. To classify the introgression status of each individual, the mean M. glaziovii allele dosage across all IDM windows was rounded such that mean dosages falling in the range (0, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), and (1.5, 2) were rounded to 0, 1, and 2, respectively, to represent generally homozygous nonintrogressed, heterozygous, and homozygous introgressed genotypes. There were no introgression data available for one individual (TMS13F1079P0007), so it was excluded from analysis. There were no individuals that were homozygous introgressed on chromosome 4., To test whether individuals with different introgression statuses have different levels of recombination locally and chromosome-wide, chi-square tests of equal counts were performed with a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of α/N, where α = 0.05 and N = 4 (the number of regions tested). The expected numbers of crossovers for each introgression class were calculated by multiplying the total number of crossover intervals falling within the introgressed region across all meioses by the proportion of informative meioses contributed by individuals of a given introgression status, which was calculated using the total number of informative meioses counted in the crossover datasets for each chromosome (such that failure to detect the obligatory crossover on a given chromosome did not count toward the difference between observed and expected crossover counts genome-wide). The same chi-square analysis was repeated for the nonintrogressed portion of chromosomes 1 and 4 to see if introgression status affected recombination frequency in regions of the chromosome outside of the introgressed region itself., Introgression status-specific genetic maps were constructed for each of the two chromosomes that contain introgressed segments using the set of crossovers detected in individuals of each introgression class (homozygous nonintrogressed, heterozygous introgressed, and homozygous introgressed). The maps were built following the same procedure as for the sex-averaged genetic maps, but the introgression maps were scaled such that their weighted average equaled the sex-averaged map. The genetic length of each SNP interval on a given introgression map was calculated by dividing the number of crossovers detected in parents of a given introgression status in a given interval by ny, the scaling factor defined above, and then multiplied by m, where m = (the total number of informative meioses across all three introgression statuses)/(the number of informative meioses contributed by individuals of a given introgression status)., Using SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM with genotype data at 35,127 SNPs for 5479 individuals in a validated cassava breeding pedigree, a total of 117,128 crossovers were detected from 7020 informative meioses. These crossover intervals were used to construct a sex-averaged genetic map with a median resolution of 420,366 bp. To examine the recombination patterns in the regions with known introgressions from M. glaziovii, introgression dosage-specific genetic maps were also constructed. To compare these maps to the existing ICGMC map, the genetic positions (cM) of our markers and ICGMC’s markers were plotted against physical position (Mb), shown in Figure 2 for chromosomes 1 and 4 and in Supplementary Figure S2 for all chromosomes., Comparison of constructed genetic maps with the ICGMC map. The genetic position of our GBS markers and ICGMC’s markers are plotted against physical position (Mb) for chromosome 1 (A), and chromosome 4 (B). Centromeric regions are shaded in purple, and M. glaziovii introgression regions are shaded in red. Five maps are shown: ICGMC’s map (red), a sex-averaged genetic map constructed from the crossovers detected in all informative parents (turquoise; labeled AWC), and three genetic maps constructed from the crossovers detected in informative meioses of parents that are homozygous nonintrogressed (0 introgressions; orange), heterozygous introgressed (1 introgression; blue), and homozygous introgressed (2 introgressions; dark green) in the respective introgression regions on chromosomes 1 and 4. Genetic positions were calculated using the number of crossovers in intervals between SNPs detected by SHAPEIT2-duoHMM passing a significance threshold of t = 0.5., Comparison of constructed genetic maps with the ICGMC map.

Genetic positions were calculated using the number of crossovers in intervals between SNPs detected by SHAPEIT2-duoHMM passing a significance threshold of t = 0.5., At the qualitative level, the observed crossover distributions were similar to the ICGMC map genome-wide. Both maps showed similar suppression of crossovers in centromeric regions, and the genetic positions generally corresponded well with some regional exceptions, such as in the centromeric region of chromosome 5 (Supplementary Figure S2). On most chromosomes, there was evidence of crossover interference. In particular, the deviance goodness-of-fit tests were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 0.00278 for all chromosomes except chromosomes 10, 17, and 18, indicating that crossovers tended to be spaced further apart than would be expected by chance if they were independent events fitting a Poisson model., A total of 51,357 crossover intervals were identified from 3446 informative male meioses and 65,771 crossover intervals were identified from 3574 informative female meioses. The number of crossovers observed genome-wide significantly differed between male and female meioses (chi-square test, P = 5.75 × 10−282; Table 3). Females had 10.3% more crossovers than expected if crossover rates were equal between the sexes.

The expected crossover counts were calculated based on the proportion of informative meioses with observed crossovers in parents of each sex. The asterisk represents significance at α = 0.05., To investigate variance between the sexes in specific chromosomal regions, chi-square tests for female and male meioses were conducted for crossover counts in 1-Mb windows along each chromosome, shown in Figure 3 for chromosome 1 and in Supplementary Figure S3 for all 18 chromosomes. Of the 506 intervals tested, 45 (8.9%) had P-values below the Bonferonni-corrected significance threshold of 9.88 × 10−5. In these 45 intervals, female crossover count was higher than expected assuming equal male and female crossover rates and male crossover count was lower than expected. Statistically significant intervals were spread throughout the genome and did not consistently appear in any specific region of the chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S3)., Crossover distribution across chromosome 1 for male and female meioses.

Table 4 lists the crossover counts that were observed and that were expected under the null hypothesis of equal recombination rates among the introgression classes. At a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 0.0125, the chi-square tests indicated that individuals of different introgression statuses experienced significantly different recombination frequencies within the introgression regions on chromosome 1 (P = 3.97 × 10−14) and chromosome 4 (P = 6.06 × 10−59), as well as in the nonintrogressed region of chromosome 4 (P = 4.50 × 10−9), but not in the nonintr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observed counts are crossover intervals detected from informative parents of each introgression status that fall within or outside of the respective introgression regions on chromosomes 1 and 4.

There were no individuals that were homozygous introgressed on chromosome 4. Asterisks represent significant P-values at a Bonferonni-corrected α = 0.05., Summary of chi-square test results for equal crossover counts between individuals of different M. glaziovii introgression statuses, both within the introgression and in the nonintrogressed regions of chromosomes 1 and 4, Summary of the number of observed crossovers and those expected under the null hypotheses of equal recombination rates between parental introgression statuses. Observed counts are crossover intervals detected from informative parents of each introgression status that fall within or outside of the respective introgression regions on chromosomes 1 and 4. Expected counts were calculated with the proportions of informative meioses contributed by parents of each introgression status. There were no individuals that were homozygous introgressed on chromosome 4. Asterisks represent significant P-values at a Bonferonni-corrected α = 0.05., In the chromosome 1 introgression region, heterozygous introgressed individuals had 14.5% fewer crossovers than expected under the null hypothesis, while homozygous introgressed individuals had even lower recombination rates (Figure 2A), with 24.8% fewer crossovers in the introgression region than expected. In the chromosome 4 introgression region, heterozygous introgressed individuals had 68% fewer crossovers than expected, and there were no homozygous introgressed individuals observed. For heterozygous introgressed individuals, more crossovers were observed relative to nonintrogressed individuals in the subtelomeric region from 0 to 5 Mb outside of the introgression, but the recombination rate flattened close to zero for most of the chromosome 4 introgression region. In contrast, for nonintrogressed individuals, the recombination rate was suppressed only in the centromeric region, but not at either end of the chromosome 4 introgression region that did not overlap the centromeric region (Figure 2B)., Using IITA’s multigenerational breeding pedigree, a total of 117,128 crossovers were detected and used to construct a new genetic map for cassava, along with a dataset of phased haplotypes, which are improved resources for informing cassava breeding decisions and for studying recombination. In this study, the genetic map was used to investigate (1) sexual dimorphism in crossover number and spatial distribution, and (2) the effect of introgressions from the wild relative M. glaziovii on crossover rates., The genetic map showed that crossover rates vary greatly along the chromosomes. The observations of suppressed recombination in centromeric regions and evidence of crossover interference on most chromosomes were consistent with expectations based on other species (Lawrence et al. 2017). The inferred crossover intervals tended to be longer in the centromeric regions, where there was lower marker density, since a recombination event can only be resolved down to the region between its two flanking heterozygous markers in the parent (Supplementary Figure S1)., The genetic map shows crossover distributions generally similar to that of the ICGMC map, although it should be noted that information from the ICGMC map was used as input when running SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM. Differences from the ICGMC map could be attributed to several factors. The ICGMC map was generated in 2015 using 10 nuclear families with 3480 meioses (ICGMC 2015), while this study used a multigenerational breeding pedigree which had more individuals and more than twice as many informative meioses. In addition, the data used in this analysis were generated using a substantially different variant discovery pipeline and included 35,127 SNPs compared to 22,403 SNPs used by the ICGMC (ICGMC 2015; Chan et al. 2016). This new genetic map also provides a resource that is directly relevant to cassava breeding programs which use germplasm from the IITA collection., Certain windows of the genome were identified with significantly more female than male crossovers (Supplementary Figure S3). This implies that the directionality of crosses matters in cassava, since the female parent of a cross is more likely to recombine than the male parent. Cassava breeders can take advantage of this information to make parent selection decisions, optimizing the chance of finding a new favorable recombination by using an individual as a female parent or the chance of preserving a favorable haplotype by using an individual as a male parent., The observation of higher crossover rates in female meioses has also been made in other species, including humans (Bhérer et al. 2017) and some other plants (Lenormand and Dutheil 2005), although heterochiasmy in the opposite direction is observed in A. thaliana (Drouaud et al. 2007). In maize, the overall number and general distribution of crossovers was found to be similar between the sexes, although higher resolution mapping showed differences in crossover placement relative to specific gene and chromatin features (Kianian et al. 2018). While there were no apparent differences in the overall spatial distribution pattern of crossovers between the sexes in this case, finer differences in crossover position could be investigated with higher resolution mapping., The mechanism underlying heterochiasmy has been elusive. Lenormand and Dutheil (2005) suggest that heterochiasmy in plants is evolutionarily driven by relative differences in selection pressure on the gametophytes, with less recombination occurring in the sex with greater opportunity for haploid selection. Their observation of lower ratio of male to female recombination rates in plant species with a low selfing rate is consistent with our findings in cassava, an outcrossing species that is rarely selfed in the breeding program. In A. thaliana and several animal species, heterochiasmy has been associated with correlated variation in synaptonemal complex length between sexes (Drouaud et al. 2007). Based on observations that transverse filament proteins are necessary for both crossover interference and heterochiasmy in A. thaliana, Capilla-Pérez et al. (2021) suggest that heterochiasmy is due to interference spacing along synaptonemal complex axes of different lengths in male and female meiocytes., Interestingly, a low-resolution map of the cassava genome constructed with SSR markers in 2001 showed that the female genetic map was actually shorter than the male map, with a 1.2 ratio of male to female recombination rate (Mba et al. 2001; Lenormand and Dutheil 2005). However, that genetic map was constructed based on a single biparental cross between a cultivar from Nigeria as the female parent and a cultivar from Colombia as the male parent (Fregene et al. 1997), so the observed heterochiasmy in the opposite direction could be attributed to differences in recombination rates between the African and Latin American germplasm. The male and female genetic maps we have constructed with GBS markers across a multigenerational pedigree have higher resolution and are more likely to be representative of the IITA breeding germplasm as a whole. However, disparity in the direction of heterochiasmy has been observed even within the same species, for example between mice subspecies (Dumont and Payseur 2011), so we cannot rule out the possibility that different subpopulations of cassava could vary in which sex exhibits the higher crossover rate., For both M. glaziovii introgression regions on chromosomes 1 and 4, individuals with one or two copies of the introgression showed significantly fewer crossovers within the introgressed regions. These findings are in agreement with previous studies in cassava that have characterized strong LD and lower recombination in the introgression regions relative to the rest of the genome (Rabbi et al. 2017; Wolfe et al. 2019). Evidence of suppressed recombination in introgression regions has also been previously reported in other interspecific hybrids, including in grape (Delame et al. 2019) and tomato (Liharska et al. 1996; Canady et al. 2006). This has important implications for the practicality of introgressing traits from wild germplasm into elite varieties, since linkage drag is exacerbated by low recombination., A leading hypothesis is that suppressed recombination in the introgression region is due to divergence between the esculenta and glaziovii haplotypes. Previous studies in plants and animals have associated higher levels of polymorphism between homologs with lower crossover frequency, thought to be due to the anti-crossover role of mismatch repair complexes that recognize interhomolog polymorphism as mismatches during strand invasion (Kolas et al. 2005; Lawrence et al. 2017; Serra et al. 2018). Structural variations in the heterozygous state can especially inhibit crossovers. In A. thaliana, crossovers were found to be suppressed within and around the region of inversions and translocations regardless of length (Rowan et al. 2019). In the case of paracentric inversions, crossovers within the inversion can produce acentric and dicentric chromosomes, leading to inviable gametes (McClintock 1931). A paracentric inversion within the chromosome 4 introgression could thus explain why fewer crossovers are observed in that region. While structural polymorphisms in the introgression region have been previously hypothesized, they have yet to be identified (Wolfe et al. 2019)., In addition, the introgression statuses of informative parents were characterized with the average M. glaziovii allele dosage in the introgression region rounded to 0,1, or 2. Individuals classified as generally homozygous introgressed still have some heterozygosity in parts of the introgression region. Therefore, residual interhomologue polymorphisms could be acting to suppress recombination in the introgression even in individuals with an M. glaziovii allele dosage of 2., While interhomologue polymorphism may be involved to some extent in local crossover suppression in the introgression regions, our observations suggest the presence of crossover modifying variants. On chromosome 1, homozygous introgressed individuals have even lower recombination rates that heterozygous introgressed individuals, which implies that a dosage effect of a variant in the introgression rather than solely heterology between homologs is responsible for crossover suppression. On chromosome 4, there were no homozygous introgressed individuals available to determine whether there is a similar dosage effect of the chromosome 4 introgression. However, crossover suppression observed in the heterozygous introgressed state extended even to the nonintrogressed region on chromosome 4. Rowan et al. (2019) found that crossovers suppression can extend up to 10 kb beyond the border of inversions in A. thaliana, but in this case, the observed chromosome-wide crossover suppression is greater than the local or regional suppression that would be expected due to heterozygous polymorphisms alone. Further investigations are needed to test these hypotheses about the mechanism underlying crossover suppression in the introgression regions., The frequency of the M. glaziovii introgression segments in the IITA breeding germplasm has been increasing due to selection on traits that are positively influenced by the introgressions, like root number and dry matter content, although there is also evidence that the introgressions are deleterious in a homozygous state (Wolfe et al. 2019). Suppressed recombination in the introgression region limits the ability to purge deleterious load carried along by linkage drag. In the case of the chromosome 4 introgression with very few crossovers in the introgressed region, tightly linked genes may be inherited together as supergenes, which may affect the structure and evolution of cassava populations (Schwander et al. 2014). With the introgression dosage-specific genetic maps, cassava breeders now have a tool to predict the frequency of recombination in the introgression region and plan population sizes accordingly to increase the chance of finding a desired recombination., Raw data and results are publicly available on the Cassavabase FTP: https://www.cassavabase.org/ftp/manuscripts/Chan_et_al_2019/.

Such lncRNAs have diverse roles in development, differentiation, and disease (Yao et al. 2019). lncRNAs are primarily localized in the nucleus where they can regulate gene expression by a variety of mechanisms, including interactions with enzymatic complexes that modify and remodel chromatin, direct transcriptional regulation via interaction with Preinitiation Complex, and regulation of alternative splicing (Squillaro et al. 2020). One of the classic examples of regulatory lncRNAs is Xist which controls female X chromosome inactivation in mammals (Yao et al. 2019). Another example is the partial derepression of human and mouse HoxD genes by mutations in the lncRNA HOTAIR (Rinn and Chang 2012; Li et al. 2013), although other studies that ablated Hotair function in mice reported little or no changes in Hox gene embryonic patterning function (Schorderet and Duboule 2011; Lai et al. 2015; Amândio et al. 2016; Yao et al. 2019)., Numerous lncRNAs have been detected within the clusters of Hox genes—evolutionarily conserved complexes of genes coding for homeobox-containing transcriptional factors that control axial patterning in bilateral animals (McGinnis and Krumlauf 1992; Kumar and Krumlauf 2016). These lncRNAs are transcribed from both coding and noncoding strands of the Hox gene clusters and can be found within Hox introns, in intergenic regions, or flanking the Hox gene clusters (Kumar and Krumlauf 2016). They can function both in cis, by regulating the adjacent Hox genes and in trans, by regulating the expression of Hox genes in other Hox clusters or by regulating or modulating the activity of non-Hox genes (Kumar and Krumlauf 2016)., The Drosophila bithorax Hox cluster (BX-C) contains three Hox genes: Ultrabithorax (Ubx), abdominal-A, and Abdominal-B, as well as many noncoding RNAs (Lipshitz et al. 1987; Sanchez-Herrero and Akam 1989; Cumberledge et al., 1990; Bae et al., 2002; Pease et al. 2013; Schor et al. 2018). Some of these noncoding RNAs are processed into microRNAs (miRNAs) that can regulate Hox expression (reviewed in Garaulet and Lai 2015), but most have no known function. An example of such a non-miRNA-containing lncRNA is bxd, which is encoded in upstream regulatory regions of the Ubx gene. Functionally, the bxd RNA has been reported to repress early transcription of Ubx in cis, perhaps by readthrough through the Ubx promoter (Petruk et al. 2006); however, the ablation of bxd RNA revealed that the early transcription repression of Ubx transcription in the bxd expressing region was very transient and no embryonic or adult Ubx mutant phenotypes were detected from bxd RNA elimination (Pease et al. 2013)., In 2013, Pease et al. (2013) discovered novel lncRNAs in a 143-kb region of the Ubx locus that included the Ubx transcription unit and its upstream bxd cis-regulatory region. One of these new lncRNAs originates in the second intron of Ubx and is transcribed in the antisense direction relative to Ubx (Pease et al. 2013), placing it among the Natural Antisense Transcript (NAT) group of noncoding RNAs (Faghihi and Wahlestedt 2009). The early embryonic domain of expression of this lncRNA was in parasegment 4; therefore, Pease and colleagues named it PS4. In accord with standard Drosophila gene nomenclature (Flybase 2020), we call this transcript lncRNA:PS4. Previous studies have shown that in numerous instances the NAT members of the sense–antisense gene pairs regulate the genes expressed from the sense strand (Faghihi and Wahlestedt 2009), raising the question whether this antisense transcript has a role in Ubx regulation. Intriguingly, the lncRNA:PS4 promoter mapped in the vicinity of the Contrabithorax1 (UbxCbx-1) insertional mutation (Lewis 1955; Bender et al. 1983). Contrabithorax is a dominant mutation that results in a transformation of some adult structures of the second thoracic segment (T2) into those of the third thoracic segment (T3), e.g., transforming wings into halteres (Lewis 1963). The UbxCbx-1 allele results from an insertion of 17 kb from a Ubx upstream regulatory element into the second intron of Ubx and is the only known Contrabithorax allele that maps to that region (Bender et al. 1983; Lewis 1955). This inverted insertion contains parts of two Ubx upstream regulatory regions: 16 kb of the pbx region and 1 kb of bxd. In Contrabithorax mutants, Ubx transcript and protein expression are abnormally activated in the wing discs, primarily in the posterior compartment of the disc, which results in a partial transformation of wing toward haltere morphology (White and Akam 1985); however, the mechanisms by which Cbx mutations ectopically activate Ubx expression are not understood., Taken together, the lncRNA:PS4 domain of early expression that is adjacent to the Ubx expression domain and the proximity of the Ubx-deregulating mutation UbxCbx-1 to lncRNA:PS4 gene lead us to investigate the following questions:, Does lncRNA:PS4 have a role in the regulation of Ubx transcription?, To what extent does the UbxCbx-1 mutation change lncRNA:PS4 transcription?, If such changes occur, do they play a role in modifying the morphological functions provided by Ubx?, We used 5′ and 3′ RACE [5′/3′ RACE kit, second generation (Roche)] to determine the start and the end of lncRNA:PS4 transcription. The extent of the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit was determined as follows: the region between the lncRNA:PS4 promoter and Ubx transcription start site was virtually subdivided into regions of about 1 kb long. These regions were cloned by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of w1118 flies. Antisense RNA probes were generated using in vitro transcription and the presence of transcripts from each region was assessed using whole-mount in situ hybridization. To determine if any of the transcribed regions were spliced, RT-PCR of 900–1100 bp amplicons spanning the entire predicted transcript was produced, followed by sequencing. For RT-PCR template generation, total RNA was extracted with RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion) to remove DNA., Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (Kosman et al. 2004). The Ubx cDNA probe was generated from the BSUbx1a plasmid (Harding et al. 1985). Another probe to detect Ubx nascent transcripts was prepared with a pBluescript plasmid clone that included the 5′-most 1.5 kb of the first intron of Ubx. The wingless probe was generated from a 3 kb clone in pBluescript plasmid (a gift from B. Cohen). lncRNA:PS4 transcription was detected via the M probe (upstream of UbxCbx-1 insertion), or the X probe (downstream of UbxCbx-1 insertion, Figure 1B). Images were obtained using Leica SP4, Leica SP5, and Leica SP8 fluorescent confocal microscopes and processed in Adobe Photoshop software., Schematic representation of lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit within the Ubx locus in wild type (A) and UbxCbx-1 mutant (B) embryos. Ubx exons are indicated as purple boxes; the second and the third exons are alternatively spliced; shading in the first and the last exons indicate untranslated regions. (A) In wild-type embryos lncRNA:PS4 transcripts (green) originate from the second intron of the Ubx gene, driven by two alternative promoters (P1 and P2). lncRNA:PS4 is transcribed in antisense direction relative to Ubx transcripts, contains no introns, and is terminated in the first intron of Ubx. The lncRNA:PS4 promoter deletion eliminates both P1 and P2 promoters. (B) In UbxCbx-1 mutants, a 17 kb insertion that contains pbx and bxd regulatory elements maps ∼1.1 kb downstream of lncRNA:PS4 transcription start sites, and produces an additional, new hybrid transcript (blue).

Locations of sequences in the in situ hybridization probes M, X, and first intron are indicated., To generate a targeted deletion of the sequences encompassing both putative promoters of lncRNA:PS4, two gRNA sequences were designed using CRISPR Optimal Target Finder (Gratz et al. 2014) and cloned into pCFD4-U6:1_U6:3tandem-gRNAs (Addgene plasmid No. 49411), using the protocol described in Port et al. (2014). The first guide RNA sequence targeting the site 182 bp upstream of the “upstream” promoter was placed under the control of the U6:1 promoter in pCFD4 vector and its sequence was GGAGTAAATTTATCTGGCTCT (in the genome, this sequence would be followed by a 3′ PAM: CGG). The guide RNA sequence targeting the “downstream” promoter was placed under the control of the U6:3 promoter and its sequence was GGTTCATTTCATTTGCCCAA (in the genome, this sequence would be followed by a 3′ PAM: CGG). gRNA cloning was verified by sequencing., Transgenic lines carrying the gRNA construct were generated by BestGene Inc (Chino Hills, CA, USA). Males of this gRNA line [genotype (y1sc*v1; P{CaryP-v+}attP40/CyO] were crossed to females carrying Vasa-Cas9 transgene either on the X chromosome (Bloomington stock No. 52669) or on the third chromosome (Bloomington stock No. 51324) and the progeny of these crosses was back-crossed. To screen for the presence of the desired deletions, we PCR-amplified the region surrounding the lncRNA:PS4 promoters from whole-fly genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of the PCR fragments. One line of transgenic flies was isolated from the cross to a female with a Vasa-Cas9 transgene on the third chromosome. This line has a 324 bp deletion that eliminates both the upstream promoter and the downstream promoter of lncRNA:PS4. Homozygotes for this deletion chromosome survive to adulthood at 5% the expected frequency, although this effect on viability does not map to the 324 bp deletion or to the Ubx region, as the chromosome with the small deletion is fully viable when crossed to a chromosome bearing the Ubx109 mutation [Df(3R)Ubx109], which deletes the entire Ubx locus., The adult wing phenotype of lncRNA:PS4 heterozygote mutants was assessed in lncRNA:PS4ΔP/TM3Sb flies, maintained as a stock. Ubx protein expression in the wing discs was assessed in lncRNA:PS4ΔP/TM3Sb, Kr-GFP flies, maintained as a stock. UbxCbx-1 mutant flies [UbxCbx-1/T(2; 3)apXa, apXa] were obtained from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (stock No. 3433). This fly strain has had the deletion for the pbx/bxd region crossed away from the insertional UbxCbx-1 mutation, so is wild type for sequences upstream of the Ubx transcription unit. UbxCbx-1 adult wing phenotypes were assessed in UbxCbx-1/TM3Sb flies that were obtained by crossing UbxCbx-1/T(2; 3)apXa, apXa flies to lncRNA:PS4ΔP/TM3Sb flies; the resulting UbxCbx-1/TM3Sb flies were maintained as a stock. Ubx protein expression in the wing discs of UbxCbx-1 heterozygotes was assessed in UbxCbx-1/TM3Sb, Kr-GFP, obtained via the cross of UbxCbx-1/T(2; 3)apXa, apXa flies to the lncRNA:PS4/TM3Sb Kr-GFP flies. UbxCbx-1/TM3Sb and UbxCbx-1/TM3Sb, Kr-GFP flies had identical wing phenotypes. Pc3 mutant flies [ln(3R)P(Pc3),Pc3/TM1] were obtained from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (stock No. 106475). UbxCbx-1/Pc3 flies were obtained via a cross between ln(3R)P(Pc3),Pc3/TM1 and UbxCbx-1/apXa, apXa; the resulting UbxCbx-1/Pc3 flies were maintained as a stock., lncRNA:PS4 was identified by Pease and colleagues in a systematic survey of noncoding RNAs originating from the Ubx gene and its upstream regulatory elements (Pease et al.. 2013). Pease and colleagues characterized the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit as spanning ∼15 kb and including nonprotein coding sequences from the first and the second Ubx introns (Pease et al. 2013). Here, we characterized the exact boundaries of the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit, using 5′ and 3′ RACE, followed by verification using fluorescent in situ hybridization with ∼1 kb probes that mapped throughout the lncRNA:PS4 region (Figure 1)., Using 5′ RACE, we determined that lncRNA:PS4 has two transcription start sites (P1 and P2), separated by 116 bp and located 14,299 and 14,182 bp downstream of the transcription start site of Ubx, respectively. Promoter site 2 is preceded by a good match, TCATTT, to the Drosophila InR promoter consensus sequence of TCAGTY (Ngoc et al. 2019, Supplementary Figure S1). Promoter 2 (P2, Figure 1) also includes a putative DPE promoter sequence (Supplementary Figure S1). Promoter 1 (P1) contains a weaker match, TCACTG, to the InR promoter consensus and no matches to a DPE consensus sequence (Supplementary Figure S1). In our 5′ RACE reactions, the genomic coordinate for the first 5′ nucleotide of the P1 transcripts is 16,720,127, and for P2 the initiation site maps to nucleotide 16,720,245 (Drosophila melanogaster genome release r6.37; Larkin et al. 2021). The 3′ RACE results indicated that lncRNA:PS4 transcripts are polyadenylated and located the 3′ end of lncRNA:PS4 transcripts to nucleotide 16,729,960 on Chromosome 3R (D. melanogaster genome release r6.37; Larkin et al. 2021). The predicted length of lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit was 9833 bp for transcripts starting from promoter P1 and 9715 bp for transcripts starting from promoter P2., To determine if any of the sections of the predicted transcript were spliced, we performed RT-PCR of 900–1100 bp amplicons spanning the entire predicted transcript, followed by sequencing. All RNA-generated sequences were the same size and sequence as genomic DNA, indicating that the lncRNA:PS4 transcript contains no introns. The only potential protein coding region identified by PhyloCSF in the lncRNA:PS4 transcript could in theory encode a 39 amino acid peptide, MLQMPTVKTKVPCCHFMNCFCSVGKSTTLTLATHKVLPS (Lin et al. 2011). We were unable to detect the conservation of this protein coding region in other Drosophila species. No palindromic miRNA precursor sequences were identified in the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit., Pease et al. (2013) described the blastoderm expression of lncRNA:PS4 as a broad stripe, with PS4 and PS10 as its anterior and posterior borders, respectively. Here, we show that lncRNA:PS4 RNA is first detected by in situ hybridization during stage 5 of Drosophila embryonic development (Figure 2A). The expression pattern of lncRNA:PS4 between stages 6 and 12 was previously characterized (Pease et al. 2013). During stages 6 and 7, the lncRNA:PS4 pattern of expression resolves into a broad and strong anterior domain and weaker posterior stripes (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2). Costaining with a wingless probe at stage 6 allowed us to map the broad anterior domain of expression to the posterior part of parasegment 4 and the entirety of parasegment 5 (segment T2 and the anterior compartment of T3; Supplementary Figure S3), thus abutting the anterior boundary of Ubx expression. lncRNA:PS4 is excluded from the ventral mesoderm primordia at this stage (Pease et al. 2013)., Embryonic pattern and nuclear localization of lncRNA:PS4 transcripts.

Throughout stages 6–10, Ubx and lncRNA:PS4 transcription domains were largely nonoverlapping; however, in a few nuclei, both lncRNA:PS4 and Ubx transcription were detected in parasegments 5 through 12 (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). High-resolution imaging at stage 7 (Figure 2, B–E) shows that in the domain of strong Ubx transcription, lncRNA:PS4 transcripts are absent from almost all Ubx transcribing nuclei (Figure 2, C–E)., To better understand the cellular localization of lncRNA:PS4 transcripts, we performed high-resolution imaging of stage 6 embryos after in situ hybridization with lncRNA:PS4 and Ubx probes and costaining with lamin antibodies that outline the nuclear envelope (Figure 2, F and G). lncRNA:PS4 signals are localized almost exclusively in the nuclear compartment (Figure 2F). There is a prominent signal corresponding to lncRNA:PS4 nascent transcripts (Figure 2F, arrowheads), as well as other small lncRNA:PS4 nuclear RNA signal “specks” that are not associated with the lncRNA:PS4 locus, presumably originating from polyadenylated transcripts that accumulate in that compartment (Figure 2B, arrows). Ubx, which was detected with a probe against its first intron, was mostly observed as the nascent transcripts being made from Ubx loci on the two homologous chromosomes (Figure 2G, arrowheads)., Using in situ hybridization, we made multiple attempts to detect spatially localized transcription from lncRNA:PS4 in wing, haltere and leg discs, using our most sensitive method of tyramide amplification. We never observed a localized signal within discs, or between different discs. The positive controls were in situ hybridizations with engrailed and Ubx cDNA probes, which had easily detectable localized signals. When using quantitative RT-PCR with gene-specific primers covering region X (Figure 1B), we did detect low-level transcripts from this region in the discs we tested (wing, leg, and haltere; Supplementary Table S1). The abundance of these low-level transcripts was slightly higher in haltere and leg discs than in wing discs, the opposite of what we expected from the embryonic expression pattern of lncRNA:PS4. The positive control was Ubx expression levels using quantitative RT-PCR on RNA from the same discs., In order to determine the exact location of UbxCbx-1 insertion in the lncRNA:PS4 region, we performed genomic PCR amplification followed by sequencing analysis of the approximate region of UbxCbx-1 insertion in UbxCbx-1/T(2; 3)apXa, apXa flies (Bloomington). This allowed us to map the UbxCbx-1 insertion location to position 16,721,339 of Chromosome 3R (D. melanogaster genome release r6.37; Larkin et al. 2021). Thus, the UbxCbx-1 insertion is located within the lncRNA:PS4 transcribed region, 1.06 kb downstream of the lncRNA:PS4 P2 transcription start site., The UbxCbx-1 insertion profoundly changes the extent and the pattern of lncRNA:PS4 embryonic transcription (Figure 3, A–C). The insertion splits the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit and results in two separate transcripts, as shown schematically in Figure 1B: a transcript containing ∼1 kb of 5′ lncRNA:PS4 sequences fused to an unknown amount of Cbx1 insertion sequence, and another transcript initiated within UbxCbx-1 insertion that is fused to the 3′ most 8.6 kb of lncRNA:PS4. The homozygous UbxCbx-1 mutant embryo shown in Figure 3, A–C demonstrates the different expression patterns of these two transcripts. In this in situ hybridization, lncRNA:PS4 transcription was imaged with two probes (Figure 1B): probe M contains 1.4 kb of sequence upstream and 0.4 kb downstream of the UbxCbx-1 insertion (Figure 3B) and probe X, located downstream of the insertion, thus detecting the transcription of the transcript that initiates within the UbxCbx-1 insertion and has 3′ sequences of lncRNA:PS4 (Figure 3A). To simplify, we will refer to this transcript as the Cbx hybrid transcript., The UbxCbx-1 insertion changes the transcription pattern of lncRNA:PS4 and generates an additional hybrid transcript containing 3′ sequences of lncRNA:PS4 driven by the bxd promoter.

Location of the M, X, and first intron probes is shown in Figure 1B.

Location of the M, X, and first intron probes is shown in Figure 1B. M probe corresponds to lncRNA:PS4 sequences 1.4 kb upstream of the UbxCbx-1 insertion and 0.4 kb downstream of it., The strongest domain of the Cbx hybrid expression was posterior to parasegment 6 and its expression extended uniformly to the posterior boundary of parasegment 12 (Figure 3A). This transcript was also observed in a few nuclei located in parasegments 4–6 (Figure 3, A and C). In addition to the abundant posterior expression relative to wild-type lncRNA:PS4, the Cbx hybrid transcript was not excluded from embryonic mesoderm, unlike wild-type lncRNA:PS4 (Figure 3, A and C, arrow). The Cbx hybrid transcript pattern mimics the normal expression pattern of the bxd transcript (Lipshitz et al. 1987; Pease et al. 2013; Petruk et al. 2006). In UbxCbx-1 mutants, the bxd promoter and regulatory sequences lie within the 17 kb UbxCbx-1 insertional mutation, in the opposite orientation to their normal direction in the BX-C complex. The expression of the Cbx hybrid transcript, therefore, appears to be driven by bxd enhancers located in the insertion. In the hybrid transcript, transcription of the 3′ region of lncRNA:PS4 extends beyond its normal termination site to at least the vicinity of the Ubx first exon, since Cbx hybrid transcripts can be detected with a probe corresponding to the 5′ most 1.5 kb of the first intron of Ubx (Supplementary Figure S4, A and B)., The M probe primarily detected the expression of the lncRNA:PS4 that is encoded upstream of the Cbx1 insertion (Figure 3B). This 5′ 1 kb region of lncRNA:PS4 continues to be transcribed in parasegments 4 and 5 and continues to be largely excluded from the mesoderm, similar to the lncRNA:PS4 in wild-type embryos (Figure 3B, arrow). Because M probe has a small amount of homology to sequences downstream of the Cbx1 insertion (Figure 1B), it also weakly detects the Cbx hybrid transcript (see the weak mesodermal signal, probably resulting from codetection of the Cbx hybrid transcript in Figure 3, B and C). Thus, in UbxCbx-1 mutants, the lncRNA:PS4 transcription unit is split into two transcripts: the 1 kb upstream of the insertion that is expressed in the largely wild-type lncRNA:PS4 pattern and another, containing over 8 kb of lncRNA:PS4 downstream of the insertion that is expressed in bxd pattern (Figure 3C)., As the UbxCbx-1 insertion eliminates the parasegment 4 and 5 expression of the 3′-most 8.6 kb of lncRNA:PS4 transcribed region, we next investigated whether this change was associated with the expansion of Ubx transcription into that region. We detected no expansion of embryonic Ubx transcription into parasegments 4 and 5 of UbxCbx-1 mutants (Supplementary Figure S4, C and D), suggesting that PS4–PS5 expression of lncRNA:PS4 was not necessary for the repression of Ubx transcription anterior to its normal domain in embryos. Furthermore, the abundant and broadened transcription of the 3′ portion of lncRNA:PS4 sequences in parasegments 6–12 of UbxCbx-1 mutants were not associated with suppression of Ubx transcription in those parasegments (Supplementary Figure S4, C and D)., Using high-resolution microscopy, we investigated whether the presence of the Cbx hybrid transcript interferes with transcription of the Ubx gene from the same locus. To that end, we detected Ubx transcription using a probe for the 5′-most region of the first, 7.5 kb-long Ubx intron, which should detect the first ∼10 min of Ubx transcription (Figure 3, D–G). In some nuclei we detected Ubx and Cbx hybrid transcripts that appeared to derive from the same DNA molecule (Figure 3, F and G), thus arguing against transcriptional interference by Cbx hybrid transcript. One caveat to this statement is that it is possible that some of the imaged chromosomes contained replicated sister chromatids and so the overlap of Cbx hybrid and Ubx transcript signals could be due to adjacent DNA molecules in cell cycle G2., To further test the function of the lncRNA:PS4 transcript, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of 324 bp that removed both of its promoters. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that lncRNA:PS4 transcription was largely eliminated in the homozygous mutants (Supplementary Figure S5). Next, we investigated the effects of the lncRNA:PS4 mutation on Ubx expression. In embryos homozygous for the promoter deletion, the abundance and pattern of Ubx transcripts were the same as in wild-type embryos. Only 5–6% of the lncRNA:PS4 homozygous mutant flies emerged as adults (with most homozygotes dying in late larva and pupa stage), apparently because of an additional mutation elsewhere on the third chromosome, since trans-heterozygotes of the lncRNA:PS4 promoter deletion over a deletion of the Ubx locus [Df(3R)Ubx109], resulted in viable adults at approximately wild-type frequencies. We then examined if the deletion of lncRNA:PS4 promoters resulted in ectopic activation of Ubx protein in larval wing discs, or in wing abnormalities.

(G, H) For comparison, the adult wings and stained wing discs in UbxCbx-1/Polycomb (Pc3) heterozygotes. Note the transformation of the wing toward haltere and the strong activation of Ubx protein throughout anterior and posterior compartments of the wing disc., We also examined whether the lncRNA:PS4 promoter deletion mutation interacted genetically with the UbxCbx-1 mutation. In wing discs heterozygous for UbxCbx-1, we observed ectopic Ubx protein in the posterior region of the disc (Figure 4D), as previously described (White and Akam 1985). In our hands, adults that were heterozygous for the UbxCbx-1 insertion had only slight defects in wing morphology (Figure 4C), likely because of accumulation of modifiers in this strain. As reported previously (Castelli-Gair et al. 1992), Polycomb (Pc3) mutants enhance the amount and extent of Ubx expression in the wing disc of UbxCbx-1 mutants (Figure 4H), and have a stronger transformation of wings toward halteres (Figure 4G). The lncRNA:PS4 promoter deletion also enhances the adult wing phenotype of UbxCbx-1 (Figure 4E), albeit much more mildly than Pc3. The ectopic expression of Ubx protein in the posterior compartment of wing discs from UbxCbx-1/lncRNA:PS4 larvae was also enhanced (Figure 4F), compared with that seen in discs of larvae heterozygous for UbxCbx-1., Although in embryos the antisense lncRNA:PS4 transcripts are expressed in cells that are largely nonoverlapping with Ubx, the function of lncRNA:PS4 seems to have little if any effect on the pattern of Ubx expression in otherwise wild-type animals. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, a small deletion that eliminates almost all lncRNA:PS4 transcription has no detectable effect on Ubx expression in embryos and in imaginal discs. Second, the abundant transcription of 3′ lncRNA:PS4 sequences driven by the UbxCbx-1 insertion in posterior regions of the embryo has no detectable repressive effect on Ubx transcription in such posterior regions., In animals that are heterozygous for UbxCbx-1 and lncRNA:PS4 promoter mutations there is an enhancement of the UbxCbx-1 phenotype, and one can interpret this as noncomplementation between these two alleles, suggesting that lncRNA:PS4 has a very subtle repressive effect on Ubx transcription in wing discs which can only be observed in a UbxCbx-1 mutant background. One possible mechanism by which the lncRNA:PS4 region may provide this subtle repression is by helping to set a repressive chromatin state in the cells in which it is expressed, as was suggested for the bxd lncRNA (Pease et al. 2013)., One puzzle is how the enhancer/promoter for lncRNA:PS4 that resides in the Ubx locus is able to activate transcription within parasegment 4, whereas the rest of the Ubx locus is repressed in parasegment 4. This seems potentially inconsistent with the “open for business” model, in which the Ubx locus as a whole has been observed to be associated with H3K27 trimethylation repressive modifications in the bulk of embryonic parasegment 4 cells (Bowman et al. 2014; Maeda and Karch 2015). Those modifications recruit Polycomb group proteins that maintain the off state of Ubx in those cells. However the expression of lncRNA:PS4 is transient in most cells of parasegment 4, and may help recruit Polycomb group complexes at very early embryonic stages that then quantitatively assist in the maintenance of Ubx repression in the cells of that parasegment through later stages of embryogenesis and beyond., The lncRNA:PS4 promoters are both contained within a predicted Polycomb Repression Element (Supplementary Figure S1; Négre et al. 2011). It may be that either lncRNA:PS4 transcripts themselves contribute to the function of this PRE or that they are merely a signal associated with the PRE regulatory element, as noncoding RNAs are often produced in the vicinity of cis-regulatory elements (Natoli and Andrau 2012). If this is the case, it is possible that the UbxCbx-1-dependent effect of lncRNA:PS4 promoter deletions on Ubx expression in the wing is due to the sequences removed from the predicted PRE, and not due to elimination of lncRNA:PS4 transcripts per se. It is also possible that lncRNA:PS4 transcripts have a repressive effect on Ubx in some cells that we did not test, but an important effect of lncRNA:PS4 on early embryonic patterning via regulation of Ubx is not supported by our results., In some respects, the Hox-encoded lncRNA:PS4 transcripts resemble that of the Hox cluster-encoded HOTAIR transcripts of mice. Different studies have proposed that HOTAIR either has an important (Rinn et al. 2007; Li et al. 2013), or largely unimportant (Amândio et al. 2016; Schorderet and Duboule 2011) role in regulating Hox gene expression and embryonic patterning. As proposed by Amândio et al. (2016), these inconsistent findings might be explained by the different genetic backgrounds in which HOTAIR mutant alleles were tested. As described here, the function of lncRNA:PS4 transcripts also seem sensitive to genetic background, as lncRNA:PS4 mutant animals only exhibit ectopic expression of Ubx and abnormal wing shapes in the background of a UbxCbx-1 mutant allele., Strains and plasmids are available upon request.

Potato is a major source of carbohydrates in human nutrition, and a main component of several industrial applications. Efforts to enhance potato tuber traits have been ongoing since cultivation first began, over 12,000 years ago between south-eastern Peru and western Bolivia (Spooner et al. 2005)., Modern potato breeding was initiated in 19th century in Europe (Knight 1807). Most modern potato cultivars are polyploid with tetrasomic inheritance (2n = 4x = 48). Due to random chromatid segregation and double reduction (a phenomenon which depends on the specific position of a gene on a chromosome), it can be very hard to predict genetic segregation in the offspring derived from a cross between two tetraploid parents (Spooner et al. 2014). The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes and has a haploid size of approximately 840 Mb (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium 2011). Since the sequencing of the potato genome, there has been an increase in genetic research on both tetraploids and related diploids., Gene mapping using linkage analysis or association genetics is more successful for, and therefore often limited to, traits with high heritability. Some traits have been successfully mapped using a genome wide association study approach or linkage analysis in a derived bi-parental population, e.g., host plant resistance to late blight (LB), nematodes and viruses, glycoalkaloid and starch content, flesh color, and tuber traits including yield (Ramakrishnan et al. 2015, and references therein). Reliable genetic mapping of tuber yield traits is a challenging research task due to low to medium narrow-sense heritability (0.142–0.291; Ortiz and Golmirzaie 2002) and the large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with very minor effects (Schönhals et al. 2017)., Early DNA marker research on potatoes was conducted using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), amplified-fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), and simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, since the development of the first high-density SNP array in 2011, which included 8303 SNPs (Hamilton et al. 2011), the accessibility of genomic information for potato has increased. The latest such high-density SNP array, which was developed by Vos et al. (2015), contains more than 22,000 SNPs. As the number of genotyping methods increase and the technology develops, the costs of genotyping large populations have decreased, and this has increased the availability of high-throughput genotypic data for small-to-medium size breeding programs., Genomic prediction is a technique that promises more precise selection and short generation intervals for the improvement of breeding efficiency. The technique has been successfully implemented in dairy cattle, pig and poultry breeding, and more recently in plant breeding, particularly for cereals, though it remains in its infancy for many crops including potato (Ortiz 2015). Genetic gains in potato breeding remain small vis-à-vis other main crops that feed the world (Gao 2021). For example, Douches et al. (1996) did not find any progress trend for tuber yield in North American cultivars released during the 20th century, although they showed improvements in quality traits for various end-users according to skin color type and the fresh and processing markets. GEBV for selection in potato breeding may be one approach to overcome this limitation (Slater et al. 2016), particularly when costs of high throughput genotyping with dense DNA markers are falling and the number of such markers does not need to be high either for genomic prediction or for association genetics (Selga et al. 2021). The major advantage of genomic selection compared to conventional, phenotype-based selection is the possibility of selecting individuals before they are planted in the field. This is done by recording phenotypic and genotypic data for a set of individuals, referred to as a training population, then using this information to fit statistical models that allow the prediction of the performance of a new set of related individuals, often referred to as a test population or breeding population, for which only genotypic information is available (Desta and Ortiz 2014, and references therein). Genomic selection requires high density markers across the whole genome and depends on the assumption that at least one genetic marker will be in linkage disequilibrium with a causative QTL for the trait of interest (Meuwissen et al. 2001). The success of genomic prediction models depends not only on the heritability of the trait of interest, but also on the relationships of the individuals included in the training and test populations (Habier et al. 2007). The performance of genomic prediction models is determined by the predictive ability of the model to determine the breeding values of the individuals in the test population based on the information provided. Cross-validations of genomic prediction models are often performed; in these, a set fraction of a population with genotypic and phenotypic data is used to predict the behavior of a smaller fraction of the population where the phenotypic information has been masked, taking a new fraction of the population for each round of prediction. The fraction of the population used as a test population (where the phenotypic information has been masked) is often set at around 20% (José Crossa, CIMMYT, pers. comm.). However, in real-life scenarios in breeding programs, the method of repeatedly cross-validating the prediction models does not reflect the conditions of predictions made over separate generations of selection. The cross-validation approach may also overestimate the accuracy of prediction as the relationship between the individuals becomes very strong when the set of individuals used in the training population changes with each run of the prediction model (Windhausen et al. 2012). Plant breeders would like to identify as potential parents those whose genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) are separated from those of the original training population in both time and space. Hence, using the same unique set of individuals consistently in training and test populations respectively may yield more realistic prediction accuracy than repeated cross-validation., In recent years, a few research articles about estimating GEBVs for important breeding traits in potato such as, among other characteristics, tuber dry matter content (or specific gravity [SG]), tuber yield, number of tubers per plant, potato chipping quality and starch content in the tubers, have become available. Some of them estimated prediction accuracy using several fold cross-validation (Habyarimana et al. 2017; Enciso-Rodriguez et al. 2018; Stich and Van Inghelandt 2018), while others validated their models using distinct training and test populations (Sverrisdóttir et al. 2017, 2018; Endelman et al. 2018). Endelman et al. (2018) used data from 11 public potato breeding programs in the USA and the recorded clones and cultivars as a training population for genomic prediction applied to unselected potato clones, often referred to as T1s in a potato breeding program, for traits such as SG and tuber yield., The objective of this research was to assess the potential of genomic selection for eight breeding traits, including tuber yield and quality, using varied genetic backgrounds of available germplasm in a finite size potato breeding program in Sweden, which, as happens elsewhere when funding for public breeding is limited, may be regarded as small or having below 10,000 T1 every year going to the field for testing (Eriksson et al. 2016). Our proposed method suggests that the more advanced breeding material, i.e., all individuals that underwent at least one cycle of selection (often referred to as T2, T3 up to Tn where n is the number of advanced generations), should be used as a training population for the unselected material in T1. We also test the approach of predicting phenotypic data across full-sib families of unselected material in T1, to ascertain whether it is possible to reduce the number of families that needs to be scored in early clonal generations., The experiments included 669 tetraploid potato clones, which were selected from three distinct populations at different stages of selection (hereafter denoted T1, T2, and T3–7) from the potato breeding program managed by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Alnarp, Sweden. The breeding populations were bi-parental offspring derived after crossing cultivars of tetraploid table potatoes, or elite breeding clones from this breeding program (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Population T1 was limited to five bi-parental families (denoted T1–A, T1–B, T1–C, T1–D, and T1–E) that had not undergone any previous selection. Four of the parents or grandparents for these families were also included in our research—“Bionica,” “Desiree,” “Sarpo Mira,” and “SW93-1015” (Table 2). The numbers of individuals differed between populations and full-sib families (Tables 1 and 2). The T1 population was larger than the other two, more advanced, breeding populations, but this mirrors the real conditions in a commercial potato breeding program, where each year the number of genotypes is reduced while the numbers of observations per genotypes are increased (Bradshaw 2017). The individuals in population T2 had been selected once in field trials. Population T3–7 contains individuals that had been selected during multiple consecutive years of field trials, ranging from 2 to 7 years., Size, number of crosses used to produce the individuals and selection cycles for each of the three populations included in this study, T1, T2, and T3–7, Size, number of crosses used to produce the individuals and selection cycles for each of the three populations included in this study, T1, T2, and T3–7, Full-sib families of population T1 with information on the number of individual genotypes for each parental cross, as well as the parents of the five crosses, “L4,” “L17,” and “L26” are full-sibs from a bi-parental cross between breeding clone “SW93-1015” and cultivar “Desirée.” Data from these two “grandparents” were also recorded alongside the data from T1., “C08II69” has “SW93-1015” as one of its parents., Full-sib families of population T1 with information on the number of individual genotypes for each parental cross, as well as the parents of the five crosses, “L4,” “L17,” and “L26” are full-sibs from a bi-parental cross between breeding clone “SW93-1015” and cultivar “Desirée.” Data from these two “grandparents” were also recorded alongside the data from T1., “C08II69” has “SW93-1015” as one of its parents., Leaf material, approximately 0.25 g, was collected on ice from each of the 669 individuals and five cultivars as checks. The leaf material was then sent to SGS—TraitGenetics GmbH for DNA extraction, genotyping, and allele scoring. Genotyping was conducted using the GGPv3.0 array (Vos et al. 2015) containing circa 22K SNPs. Quality control for the extracted DNA was conducted by running samples on a gel to check for fractionation. All samples were found to be suitable for further analysis. Genotype calling was done using the software “Illumina GenomeStudio” (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), with four alleles scored per locus. After removing SNP markers with more than 10% missing scores, 14884 markers remained. Missing values were imputed with Population mode which deploys the most frequent allelic state using the R package “GWASpoly” (Rosyara et al. 2016). To ensure a genotype matrix with polymorphic markers, those SNP markers with a minor allele frequency smaller than 0.05 were discarded. The number of markers available for analysis following marker filtration based on minor allele frequency differed depending on the individuals included. When all individuals were included (n = 669), the number of markers was 10,546. For the smaller sets, including 647 and 200 individuals, the total numbers of markers after filtration were 10,499 and 11,219, respectively. The allelic states were translated from base pairs to numeric format to facilitate further processing of genomic data. The numeric data consisted of five allelic states, ranging from 0 to 4, in which 0 and 4 represent the two homozygotes OOOO and AAAA, and 1, 2, and 3 represent the three possible heterozygotes AOOO, AAOO, and AAAO, respectively., Similarity between individuals was used as an additional quality control measure for the SNP array. Allele callings were compared between individuals over all markers. Individuals genotyped twice were compared to each other, with an expectation of very small differences between allele callings. Related and unrelated individuals were compared to each other, with a higher degree of difference expected. Similarity checks of genotypic data were done using the R statistical package (R Core Team 2021)., To reveal whether there was any population structure among the individuals, a Euclidian distance matrix was calculated based on marker data. Using the R package “adegenet,” a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was conducted with the Euclidean distance matrix (Jombart 2008; Jombart and Ahmed 2011). The PCoA was visualized using the R package “ggfortify” (Tang et al. 2016; Horikoshi and Tang 2018)., The tubers for the field experiments were brought up from plants grown in a greenhouse for population T1, and from field grown plants in northern Sweden (84°N, 20°26′E) for T2 and T3–7, to limit the number of virus-infected tubers. Data from the three populations were recorded at three sites in Sweden (Helgegården, Mosslunda—both in Skane in south Sweden—and Umeå in the north) in 2018. For population T1, data were taken at Mosslunda (55°98′N, 14°10′E), with one repetition of, in total, four observations in 2018. Host plant resistance to foliar LB, caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, was scored during the cropping season in 2016, from 21st July (first sighting of the disease in the field) until 29th September. Data from T2 were recorded in the same field as the T1 in 2018; i.e., from 10-plant plots. The data from T3–7 were collected at the same field site as T1 and T2 and for 38 of its breeding clones at two additional sites (Helgegården: 56°02′N 14°07′E and Umeå: 63°84′N 20°26′E) in 2018 using 20-plant plots. The tubers of all Tis were sown between 14th and 15th May, and they were harvested on 11th and 12th October. Five cultivars (“Bintje,” “Carolus,” “Connect,” “King Edward,” and “Solist”) were planted at all three field sites. All phenotypic records were adjusted by location using the means of the five cultivars from each location, with the exception of LB which was scored only on a per-plant basis., Phenotypic data for eight important breeding traits were recorded in the field during the cropping season and after harvest. For each plant, tuber weight (TW) was measured in kilograms and tuber number (TN) was recorded at harvest. The average tuber weight (ATW) measured in kilograms was calculated by dividing TW by TN. Likewise, at harvest, tuber uniformity, Eye depth, Shape, and Size (from now on referred to as Eye, Shape, and Size) were estimated using a discrete scale ranging from 1 (nonuniform) to 9 (uniform). Finally, SG was recorded as the weight of tubers in air divided by the weight of tubers in water. TW, TN, and ATW were recorded for all three populations (648–669 genotypes) across all sites (with one or two replicates per site). Eye, shape, size, and SG were recorded for populations T2 and T3–7 (200 genotypes) across all sites (with one or two replicates per site). LB was scored only in the T1 population (465 genotypes), and data were collected six times over the course of plant growth. These scores were used to estimate the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) according to known international standards (Forbes et al. 2014). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for each trait in order to study differences in performance among the populations. For the traits collected for T1, Tukey’s range test of means (Tukey 1949) was conducted to determine any differences among the five families., We partitioned the data into two sets, training and test, in order to study the model’s predictive ability. The sets were assigned based on generations: T1, T2, T3–7 and the combination of T2 and T3–7 (hereafter referred to as T2–7). To increase the genetic overlap between populations, the parents and grandparents of the full-sib families in T1 were included in the population T2–7 for prediction of the tuber yield traits. The set with individuals at later stages of selection was assigned as the training set, which was used to train the model to generate GEBVs for the test set made up of individuals from earlier generations in the breeding program. For each partition, we fitted model (2) and we computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values. The model was fitted using the Bayesian framework with the BGLR package (Pérez and de los Campos 2014). Inferences were based on 30,000 samples after discarding 15,000 samples that were used as burn-in., Cross-family analysis was conducted for two of the full-sib families from the first clonal generation (T1-C and T1-D). The families were assigned to the training or test set separated by family, and the model's predictive ability was assessed as described for cross-population analysis in the section above., The population was also randomly divided using fivefold schemes for each of the seven traits. The individuals were randomly assigned to five disjoint groups, where one acted as test set and the other groups as training set, and the process was repeated until all individuals had been given a predicted phenotypic value. For each partitioning we fitted model (2) following the same procedures as described in the previous section. Each fivefold validation was run 100 times, with new randomly assigned groups. The mean prediction accuracy for the cross-validation was calculated as the mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values. Cross-validation was also conducted within two full-sib families from the first clonal generation (T1-C and T1-D). The partitioning and model fitting followed the same approach as when all individuals were included., Genotyping of 669 individuals from three breeding populations from various stages of a potato breeding program (including the parents and grandparents of some of these offspring) was done using an SNP array. There were 10,546 polymorphic SNPs of high quality for all the individuals of the breeding populations. The SNP array was deemed robust, as less than a 0.5% difference in genotype calling was found among samples collected from the same individual, while on average randomly drawn individuals from the data set had a difference of 50% between the genotype callings., A PCoA including the polymorphic markers of the 669 individuals revealed clear population structure (Figure 1). The first principal coordinate (PC1) explained 12.77% of the variation in the genotypic data set while the second principal component (PC2) accounted for 5.43% of this variation. There was distinct separation of the more elite breeding material (T2 and T3–7), which included more bi-parental families than the T1 (consisting of only five bi-parental families). No such strong population structure due to genotypic data was found among the later stages of selection. The population structure was also studied for population T1 (Supplementary Figure S1), and T2 and T3–7 (Supplementary Figure S2) by conducting separate PCoAs based on the Euclidean distance matrix computed using the markers for the individuals within each of the two populations. These plots revealed the same results as the PCoA containing data from all individuals, with populations T2 and T3–7 having less defined population structure than the five families from population T1. The % variance explained by the two first PCs was slightly higher for the T1 population (PC1 accounted for 11.87% and PC2 accounted for 7.24%) than for the T2 and T3–7 populations (PC1 accounted for 9.45% and PC2 accounted for 5.98%). The structure among the five T1 full-sib families was distinct, with a majority of the full-sibs clustering together (Supplementary Figure S1). T1-C, T1-D, and T1-E, which all share a male crossing parent and where the female crossing parent are full-sibs, seem to be at a closer genetic distance compared to the other two families. T1-A share one crossing parent with T1-B and one with T1-C, T1-D, and T1-E. The individuals included in T1-A were at an equal distance to T1-B and the other three half-sib families., Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the Euclidian genetic distance between genotyped individuals. Colored groupings are made based on breeding populations across various selection cycles, T1–T3–7. The five full-sib families of population T1 are also separated by color. Four cultivars or breeding clones from the bi-parental crosses that produced the T1 families are included as breeding parents. PC1 and PC2 are the % variance explained by the two first principal components., Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the Euclidian genetic distance between genotyped individuals. Colored groupings are made based on breeding populations across various selection cycles, T1–T3–7. The five full-sib families of population T1 are also separated by color. Four cultivars or breeding clones from the bi-parental crosses that produced the T1 families are included as breeding parents. PC1 and PC2 are the % variance explained by the two first principal components., As the data were taken from several field sites, the means adjusted by site were calculated to allow comparisons within and amongst the populations. There were differences in performance for the tuber yield traits (TW, TN, and ATW) among the three populations T1, T2, and T3–7 (Figure 2, A–C), and these differences were found to be significant (Supplementary Table S3). T1 had on average much lower scores for TW and TN than T2 and T3–7 (P < 0.001) (Figure 2, A and B). For ATW, the individuals in T2 were more similar to the individuals in T1, while individuals from T3 had higher scores (Figure 2C). The parents or grandparents of the five T1 families showed a poor performance for TW and TN, but slightly higher than the mean of the T1 population (Figure 2, A and B). However, for ATW, their performance was similar to that of T3–7 individuals (Figure 2C). ANOVAs were conducted to determine the difference between the two populations separated by time (T2 and T3–7). There were significant differences in SG and Size between the T2 and T3–7 populations (Figure 3, A and B; Supplementary Table S3). The populations did not differ for Shape and Eye (Figure 3, C and D, Supplementary Table S3). Data for four phenotypic traits were available for the T1 population (TW, TN, ATW, and LB). The phenotypic scores among the five full-sib families in T1 were very similar, but some significant differences were detected (Supplementary Figure S3, A–D, Table S4). Families T1-C and T1-D were the two largest among the five families, and were studied in more detail in subsequent analysis. Between these two families, TW, TN, and ATW differed (P < 0.001), while no difference was found for LB., Phenotypic scores for (A) TW per plant, (B) TN per plant, and (C) average TW, across breeding cycles in the potato breeding population and clones and cultivars representing the breeding parents, y-axis.

Phenotypes are adjusted per location by the means of five cultivars used as checks., The H2 values for the three tuber yield traits—TW, TN, and ATW—were moderately high at 0.64, 0.668, and, 0.692 respectively (Table 3). Both Eye and SG had high H2 estimates, 0.622 and 0.702. On the other hand, Size and Shape had low heritability: 0.094 and 0.016, respectively (Table 3). Trait heritability, based on variance components, was estimated for the whole population, and for the same individuals as H2, separately (Table 3). Phenotypic variation estimates will depend on the trait scoring system used, and therefore comparisons between traits were not pursued., Broad-sense heritability and variation for the seven phenotypic traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW), SG and uniformity of tuber size and shape and tuber eye depth, Heritability and variation were calculated for the 38 individuals present at all three locations. The total variation represents the phenotypic variation among all individuals scored (n = 200–669)., Broad-sense heritability and variation for the seven phenotypic traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW), SG and uniformity of tuber size and shape and tuber eye depth, Heritability and variation were calculated for the 38 individuals present at all three locations. The total variation represents the phenotypic variation among all individuals scored (n = 200–669)., GEBVs were predicted for each of the seven phenotypic traits using the Ridge Regression to estimate individual marker effects. To test the effectiveness of predicting traits across populations, the phenotypic values of the population with individuals from the two first stages of the breeding program (T1 or T2 depending on trait data availability) were removed. By building a prediction model utilizing the phenotypic data from individuals at later cycles of selection in the breeding program as well as the genetic relationship between individuals, the phenotypic values could be estimated. A phenotypic trait was said to be predictable if the prediction accuracy was above 0. The linear model was able to predict all traits. The predictive ability varied greatly across phenotypic traits., There was no general trend as to a trait’s heritability and the predictive ability of GEBVs. The tuber yield traits—TW, TN, and ATW—were predicted using two different assignments of training and test sets, as these were the only traits that were collected for population T1. The model’s predictive ability did not differ depending on which populations were included, except for ATW (Table 4). The prediction accuracy was increased from 0.04 to 0.18 when population T1 was excluded, allowing T3–7 to act as a training set to predict phenotypic values for T2. Overall, the lowest prediction accuracy was for TW, TN, and Shape (Table 4). SG had the highest prediction accuracy, i.e., 0.43. Size and Eye also showed moderately high predictive ability., Prediction accuracy (correlation between observed and predicted phenotypes) for seven breeding traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW), SG and uniformity of tuber size and shape and tuber eye depth, Model validation was conducted either on the populations divided by cycle of selection, or by randomly partitioned fivefold cross validations., For the cross validation the total population was divided at random, mean prediction accuracies over 100 model runs., Prediction accuracy (correlation between observed and predicted phenotypes) for seven breeding traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW), SG and uniformity of tuber size and shape and tuber eye depth, Model validation was conducted either on the populations divided by cycle of selection, or by randomly partitioned fivefold cross validations., For the cross validation the total population was divided at random, mean prediction accuracies over 100 model runs., To further assess the models’ performance, the data were also partitioned randomly in a fivefold cross-validation approach. The predictive ability of the cross-validations differed from when the data training test sets were assigned by cycles of selection, for four of the seven traits (Table 4). The fivefold cross-validation allowed for a more ideal situation when computing prediction modeling. Compared to our partitioning based on cycles of selection, a cross-validation approach increases the genetic overlap between the training and test set, and limits the relative size of the test set (Daetwyler et al. 2013). TW, TN, ATW, and SG were traits that showed an increased predictive ability when using the cross-validation approach, compared to our approach of partitioning the training and testing sets. However, accuracy for prediction of traits such as Size, Shape, and Eye was very similar for both partitioning methods., GEBVs were predicted using the two largest full-sib families from the first clonal generation, T1. Four phenotypic traits were available for the two families, and were predicted using model (2). The prediction model was built using the phenotypic data from one family (T1-C or T1-D) with the genetic relationship between individuals, and the phenotypic values were estimated for the other family (T1-C or T1-D). All traits except TN were predictable using the linear model (Table 5). The predictive ability was similar regardless of which of the two families were used as test set and training set. The highest predictive ability was found for LB (0.29–0.31), while TW and ATW had relatively low predictive ability. In addition to the across family prediction, GEBVs were also predicted within the families separately using randomly assigned fivefold cross-validation. The predictive ability was greater for three out of four traits when using cross-validation, compared to when the data was partitioned into training and ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
est sets according to family grouping (Table 5). However, accuracy in prediction of LB was lower when using the cross-validation approach. The predictive ability for the four traits differed depending on which of the two families was used in the model. The greatest difference in predictive ability between the two families was for TN, where predictive ability was 0.07 for cross-validation within T1-C and 0.26 for cross-validation within T1-D., Prediction accuracy (correlation between observed and predicted phenotypes) for four breeding traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW) and host plant resistance to late blight (LB), Model validation was conducted on individuals divided by full-sib family or by randomly partitioned fivefold cross validation within each full-sib family. The symbol “-” indicates that the prediction accuracy for the trait was negative, i.e., prediction was not possible., For the cross validation within the full-sib family, individuals were divided at random, mean prediction accuracies were estimated over 100 model runs., Prediction accuracy (correlation between observed and predicted phenotypes) for four breeding traits: tuber weight per plant (TW), tuber number per plant (TN), average weight per tuber (ATW) and host plant resistance to late blight (LB), Model validation was conducted on individuals divided by full-sib family or by randomly partitioned fivefold cross validation within each full-sib family. The symbol “-” indicates that the prediction accuracy for the trait was negative, i.e., prediction was not possible., For the cross validation within the full-sib family, individuals were divided at random, mean prediction accuracies were estimated over 100 model runs., As proposed by Bradshaw (2017), introducing genomic selection for the first year of clonal selection would have a large impact on the efficiency of a potato breeding program. At this stage in the potato breeding cycle, the number of replications is the limiting factor for accurate phenotyping. Many key breeding traits, such as tuber yield, shape and size, cannot be accurately assessed until later vegetative generations, where more tubers from the same clone are available for planting in the field. In this study, we attempted to implement the proposition described above by implementing genomic selection in a potato crossbreeding program that includes several different generations of clonal selection., The degree of population structure differed greatly among the different populations (Figure 1). It was clear that the individuals in the T1 generation had very limited genetic overlap with the populations made up of later clonal generations. This was likely because the population T1 included a very small number of parents in the pedigrees, while T2 and T3 had a broader parentage, thus making the effective population size of T1 much smaller than those of the later clonal generations. We theorized that the limited genetic overlap and difference in effective population size between T1 and the other populations could influence the predictive ability when using T2 and T3–7 as training sets for predicting GEBVs with genomic prediction models. The overall low accuracy of prediction for tuber yield traits, compared to the prediction accuracy estimated in previous research, is most likely due to the relatively large populations used to validate the GEBVs in our experiments (Desta and Ortiz 2014). The genetic overlap among the five full-sib families from T1 was remarkably limited, considering that every family shares one crossing parent with at least one other family (Table 2, Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1). We infer that this clear population structure among the five families may occur due to the nature of tetrasomic inheritance., Comparing our results to results from previous research on the use of GEBVs for selection in potato breeding is difficult, as methods to estimate trait predictive ability, population structure of the investigated population, and methods of partitioning test and training sets vary greatly. Previous research indicated that tuber yield had a prediction accuracy of above 0.5 (Stich and Van Inghelandt 2018) using cross-validations. However, when distinct sets of training and test populations were used (Habyarimana et al. 2017; Endelman et al. 2018), the accuracy for tuber yield was estimated as not exceeding 0.3. Previous studies that used division of training-test sets had a maximum of 30% of the total number of individuals as a test set, while in our study, some divisions were of the same proportions, and some were divisions where the test set makes up more than 50% of the total number of individuals. Since the number of individuals is far greater in the early stages of clonal selection compared to the advanced stages in a crossbreeding program, using a training population of a smaller size than the targeted test population could be difficult, but this is a challenge to circumvent. Our prediction accuracies, using the fivefold cross-validation approach, are consistent with those of cross-validation models available in the literature (Habyarimana et al. 2017; Stich and Van Inghelandt 2018; Sverrisdóttir et al. 2018; Caruana et al. 2019); i.e., the estimates for tuber yield are within the 0.3–0.54 range, for dry matter or starch content or SG within the range 0.3–0.8, and for eye depth 0.54., Studies on the power of GEBVs estimated within and across full-sib families have proven these methods successful for breeding other crops such as, for example, wheat, maize, and sugar beet (Zhao et al. 2015). To our knowledge, this study is the first to predict GEBVs across and within full-sib families of potato (Table 5). The prediction accuracies obtained for TW and ATW across the two T1 families (T1-C and T1-D) were similar to the prediction accuracies obtained across different generations of selection (Table 4). LB yielded the highest accuracy out of the traits scored for T1, and unfortunately, this trait was not scored for the advanced Ti generations. LB has been included in other previous genomic selection studies on potato. The prediction accuracy for LB we obtained in the across family predictions are similar to what Enciso-Rodriguez et al. (2018) found using randomly partitioned cross-validations. According to our results, predicting LB across full-sib families gave higher accuracy than within the same family. This is not in line with previous research on genomic selection for biparental families, where full-sibs yield higher prediction accuracies than half-sibs (Brauner et al. 2020). TW, TN, and ATW all had higher prediction accuracies for the within family predictions, but the accuracies varied depending on which of the two families the prediction was for. One family did not consistently have higher prediction accuracies than the other, but the results depended on which trait was being predicted. The difference in prediction accuracies between the families might be due to the genetic background of the individuals, or the different spread of phenotypic ranges between T1-C and T1-D, or the variance among cross-validations (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S5)., The predictions for TW and TN are low regardless of whether the training-test sets were set up between different generations of selection (Table 4). The exception for this trend was noted for predictions of ATW, where a slightly higher prediction accuracy was observed after partitioning the split between training and test sets. The predictions for ATW were less accurate when using the T2 and T3–7 populations as a training set for GEBVs of the T1 population. One reason that ATW shows a higher predictive ability compared to TN and TW could be the distribution of the phenotypic data for these traits (Figure 2, A–C). On average, the adjusted means per location for TW and TN differed greatly; i.e., values were lower for population T1 compared to populations T2 and T3. The values for ATW were much more homogenous over the three populations. Hence, the lower prediction accuracy for TW and TN could be due to the range of phenotypic variation found in each of the two clonal selection generations (unselected T1, compared to T2 and T3 which have undergone at least one cycle of selection) not being represented in the generation used for training the prediction model., The predictive ability of GEBVs for SG has been estimated in previous research on the potential of genomic selection for potato breeding, either by estimating it as tuber starch content (Sverrisdóttir et al. 2017; Stich and Van Inghelandt 2018) or, as here, as the direct measure of the SG or the dry matter content in the tubers (Habyarimana et al. 2017; Endelman et al. 2018; Sverrisdóttir et al. 2018). The prediction accuracy for SG in our research using generation-based partitioning is lower than the prediction accuracy estimated in the previous cited research, but still within their range of estimations depending on the method and partitioning of training and test sets used for the prediction models., The heritability estimates for our population are, to a very limited degree, reflected in the prediction accuracy of the phenotypic traits. The highest H2 was found for SG, which also displayed the highest predictive ability (Table 3). However, high heritability was also found for the tuber yield traits, which displayed very low predictive ability when using our partitioning of training and test sets based on cycle of selection. The predictive ability of the fivefold cross-validation approach (Table 4) gives a better reflection of the high H2 estimates found in the tuber yield traits. There is a correlation between highly heritable traits and high prediction accuracy of GEBVs (Zhang et al. 2017). However, there is not a one to one correlation between trait heritability and cross-validation predictive ability. When looking at the results for all traits collectively, a general trend is apparent. Some of the highest H2 and prediction accuracy were for TW, TN, and ATW, while Size, Shape, and Eye had the lowest for both. The total numbers of individuals used to produce the cross-validation prediction accuracy were much smaller for SG, Size, Shape, and Eye, which might have affected the model’s predictive ability, since a smaller sample size will result in higher standard errors (Altman and Bland 2005). Trait heritability, on the other hand, was not affected by population size because the same individuals were used for this estimate for the seven traits. LB was not included in the heritability estimates as this trait was not measured in the T3–7 clones used to calculate H2. LB has previously been reported to have moderate to moderate-high narrow-sense heritability (ranging between 0.31–0.69, Pajerowska-Mukhtar et al. 2009; Solano et al. 2014; Enciso-Rodriguez et al. 2018)., As previously mentioned, yield traits in potato have low to medium narrow-sense heritability (Ortiz and Golmirzaie 2002; Schönhals et al. 2017), which includes additive and digenic variation, while the broad sense heritability (H2) for these traits in our research may be overestimated by including therein the other nonadditive genetic variation (tri- and quadri-genic intra locus and inter-locus interactions or epistasis). One explanation for this can be found when looking at the standard error of the variance due to genotypic effect, which is very high, for TN per plant (Table 3). Among the other known research on genomic selection in potato, only Stich and Van Inghelandt (2018) included an estimation of heritability for tuber yield (0.77), and even if their prediction accuracy for this trait was higher than ours, taking into account previous results it is still reasonable to think that this high heritability value was overestimated., To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to include estimations of GEBVs for tuber uniformity traits, which, according to our results, seem to be partially predictable using GEBVs, but with a low accuracy ranging between 0.08 and 0.2, and depending on the sizes and genetic relationships of the test and training sets. Across generational predictions were also successful for these traits and could probably be improved with a larger population size, e.g., by including data from the T1 population., In conclusion, based on our results and the results of previous research as cited above, we remain cautious about proposing genomic selection as a standard breeding method for improving potato following the approach of across selection cycle predictions. The main problems, if this method is to be introduced as a genomics-based selection approach in a small potato breeding enterprise with a finite population size, are likely to be the large number of individuals included in the test set relative to the training set, and the limited genetic overlap between generations based on marker and pedigree research. The limited pedigree-based relationship between clonal generations seen in this study would, however, not reflect the relationships over generations found in other potato breeding programs. Our T1 population is not a typical first clonal generation because of the small number of parents involved. Often, a breeding program would use the same parents for several years in the crossing blocks, and this may lead to more genetic overlap between the clonal generations than in those used in our study. However, such an approach may lead to inbreeding, which is undesirable in potato breeding. On the matter of the limited size of the training population relative to the test population, the inclusion of historical data to train the model will be an option once genomic selection has been introduced as a method in the breeding program for a few years. This would increase the genetic diversity and population size of the training set used to train the model to develop GEBVs, and hence increase the predictive ability of the genomic selection model (Isidro et al. 2015; Cericola et al. 2017; Sverrisdóttir et al. 2018). With the data available from this finite size breeding program, we have demonstrated that genomic prediction for selection based on GEBVs would be hard to implement for various target potato breeding traits using cross population predictions. Though the implementation of genomic selection in early clonal generations would limit the number of clonal generations needing to be evaluated using costly and labor-intensive field trails every year, the predictive ability using later cycles of selection to predict the performance of this material is not adequate following this approach. The predictive ability values across full-sib families are also very low for tuber yield traits, though relatively high for LB. The best prediction accuracies were obtained using within family predictions, and following this approach could make potato breeding more efficient as one could phenotype only a portion of the offspring produced in bi-parental crosses. However, the accuracy will vary depending on the genetic background of the trait of interest and the number of full-sibs in the family., The datasets generated in this study are available through figshare, https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.14376938.

A second pathway involving an interaction between the yKu complex and telomerase RNA (TLC1) contributes to telomerase recruitment but cannot sufficiently recruit telomerase on its own to prevent replicative senescence when the primary Cdc13-Est1 pathway is abolished—for example, in the cdc13-2 mutant. In this study, we find that mutation of PIF1, which encodes a helicase that inhibits telomerase, suppresses the replicative senescence of cdc13-2 by increasing reliance on the yKu-TLC1 pathway for telomerase recruitment. Our findings reveal new insight into telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance., Telomeres are composed of G/C-rich repetitive sequences at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes and play a pivotal role in genome maintenance by “capping” chromosome ends, preventing them from unwanted nucleolytic degradation, homologous recombination, and fusion with neighboring chromosomes (Jain and Cooper 2010). In addition, to overcome progressive telomere shortening due to the end replication problem, telomeres are elongated by a specialized reverse transcriptase called telomerase. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomerase is minimally composed of the protein subunit Est2 and the RNA subunit TLC1 (Singer and Gottschling 1994; Lingner et al. 1997). However, additional accessory proteins, Est1 and Est3, are required for telomerase activity in vivo and are thought to be involved in the recruitment and/or activation of telomerase (Wellinger and Zakian 2012). Eliminating any of the Est proteins or TLC1 results in an “ever shorter telomeres” (est) phenotype characterized by progressive telomere shortening that ultimately leads to replicative senescence (Lundblad and Szostak 1989; Singer and Gottschling 1994; Lendvay et al. 1996)., Maintaining telomere length homeostasis through the regulation of telomerase is essential for genome stability. Several lines of evidence suggest that the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres involves a direct interaction between the Est1 subunit of telomerase and Cdc13, a protein that binds single-strand telomeric DNA with high affinity (Lin and Zakian 1996; Nugent et al. 1996). Expression of a Cdc13-Est2 fusion protein can support telomere maintenance in an est1Δ null mutant, suggesting that the main function of Est1 is to bring telomerase to telomeres (Evans and Lundblad 1999). Cdc13 is essential for telomere capping, so a null mutation is lethal; however, an extensively studied point mutant, cdc13-2, is not capping defective but displays an est phenotype (Nugent et al. 1996). The amino acid mutated in cdc13-2, E252, lies within the recruitment domain (RD), which is able to recruit telomerase to telomeres when fused to the DNA-binding domain of Cdc13 (Pennock et al. 2001). The mutation (E252K) results in a charge swap and can be suppressed by est1-60, which encodes a mutant Est1 with a reciprocal charge swap (K444E), suggesting a direct physical interaction between the two proteins (Pennock et al. 2001). Consistent with this idea, purified full-length Cdc13 and Est1 interact in vitro (Wu and Zakian 2011), and structural analysis revealed two conserved motifs within the Cdc13 RD, called Cdc13EBM-N and Cdc13EBM-C (referring to N- and C-terminal Est1-binding motifs, respectively), responsible for this interaction (Chen et al. 2018). The Cdc13 E252K mutation resides within the latter motif. Surprisingly, mutations in the Cdc13EBM-C motif, including E252K, do not abolish the interaction between Cdc13 and Est1 in vitro despite causing a dramatic reduction in Est1 telomere association in vivo (Chan et al. 2008; Wu and Zakian 2011; Chen et al. 2018). Thus, the mechanism by which the Cdc13EBM-C motif promotes telomerase-mediated telomere extension is still unclear., In contrast, mutations in Cdc13EBM-N abolish the Cdc13-Est1 interaction in vitro, yet only result in a modest reduction in Est1 telomere association and short, but stable, telomere length in vivo (Chen et al. 2018). This telomerase recruitment pathway works in parallel with a second pathway involving Sir4, the yKu complex, and TLC1. Double-strand telomeric DNA is bound by Rap1 (Buchman et al. 1988; Conrad et al. 1990), which interacts with Sir4 (Moretti et al. 1994). Sir4, in turn, interacts with the Yku80 subunit of the yKu complex (Roy et al. 2004), which binds to the tip of a 48-nt hairpin in TLC1 (Peterson et al. 2001; Stellwagen et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2018). Mutations that abolish the yKu-TLC1 interaction (e.g., tlc1Δ48 and yku80-135i) result in slightly short but stable telomeres (Peterson et al. 2001; Stellwagen et al. 2003), much like Cdc13EBM-N mutations. Disrupting both the yKu-TLC1 interaction and Cdc13EBM-N-Est1 interaction results in an est phenotype (Chen et al. 2018)., Pif1, a 5′–3′ helicase that is evolutionary conserved from bacteria to humans, directly inhibits telomerase activity at telomeres and DNA double-strand breaks (Schulz and Zakian 1994). Pif1 has both mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms; by altering the first (pif1-m1) and the second (pif1-m2) translational start sites, the functions can be separated (Schulz and Zakian 1994). The pif1-m2 mutant abolishes nuclear Pif1 and, similar to pif1Δ, has elongated telomeres (Schulz and Zakian 1994). In vitro, purified Pif1 reduces telomerase processivity and displaces telomerase from telomeric oligonucleotides (Boulé et al. 2005). In vivo, deletion of PIF1 increases telomere association of Est1, while overexpression of PIF1 reduces telomere association of Est1 and Est2 (Boulé et al. 2005)., We previously showed that a double-strand break adjacent to at least 34 bp of telomeric sequence is efficiently extended by telomerase, resulting in the addition of a de novo telomere, but this does not occur in Cdc13EBM-C mutants, such as cdc13-2 (Strecker et al. 2017). Surprisingly, we found that the lack of telomere addition in cdc13-2 cells can be suppressed by the pif1-m2 mutation (Strecker et al. 2017). In this study, we find that pif1-m2 suppresses the replicative senescence caused by the cdc13-2 mutation in a manner dependent on the yKu-TLC1 telomerase recruitment pathway. In addition, pif1-m2 suppresses the replicative senescence caused by disrupting both the yKu-TLC1 and Cdc13EBM-N–Est1 interactions. These observations provide new insight into the complexity of telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance., All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Standard yeast genetic and molecular methods were used (Sherman 2002; Amberg et al. 2005). The YEp24-CDC13 plasmid was first described in an article from the Hartwell lab, where it was originally designated YEp24-CDC13-161-4 (Garvik et al. 1995). Plasmids pEFS4 (pRS415-cdc13-F237A) and pFR96 (pRS415-cdc13-F237A, E252K) were created by site-directed mutagenesis of pDD4317 (pRS415-CDC13; Strecker et al. 2017) using primers designed by NEBaseChanger and the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Cat. No.: E0554S). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing., Yeast strains used in this study, Yeast strains used in this study, Liquid culture senescence assays were performed essentially as previously described (van Mourik et al. 2016). Each senescence assay started with diploid strains. Freshly dissected haploid spores were allowed to form colonies on YPD agar plates after two days of growth at 30°C. Cells from these colonies were serially passaged in liquid culture medium at 24-h intervals. For each passage, the cell density of each culture was measured by optical density (calibrated by cell counting using a haemocytometer), and the cultures were diluted back into fresh medium at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cell density was plotted as a function of population doublings., Telomere length analysis by Southern blotting was performed essentially as previously described (van Mourik et al. 2018). A 1.8-kb DNA fragment containing telomeric sequences generated from the BsmAI-digestion of plasmid pYt103 (Shampay et al. 1984) was loaded together with each sample. Southern blots were probed with a telomere-specific probe (5′-TGTGGGTGTGGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′)., To investigate how telomere addition is possible in a cdc13-2 pif1-m2 genetic background, we serially passaged cells to determine whether they would senesce. For these experiments, we used strains from our previous study (Strecker et al. 2017): cdc13Δ or cdc13Δ pif1-m2 cells, kept alive by the presence of a high-copy plasmid expressing wild-type CDC13 and the URA3 gene, transformed with an additional high-copy plasmid containing either CDC13 or cdc13-2. These cells also carried a deletion of RAD52 to prevent homologous recombination-mediated telomere maintenance (Claussin and Chang 2015). We then counterselected the first plasmid by growing cells on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which is toxic to cells expressing URA3. 5-FOA-resistant colonies were subsequently serially passaged on agar plates (Figure 1A). Senescence was apparent for cdc13-2 PIF1 cells already after the first passage, whereas CDC13 and cdc13-2 pif1-m2 strains did not show any sign of senescence even after the fourth passage. We analyzed the telomere length of these strains and found that, consistent with previous studies, pif1-m2 has increased telomere length compared with wild type (Schulz and Zakian 1994) while the telomeres are very short in the cdc13-2 mutant (Lendvay et al. 1996; Nugent et al. 1996). Interestingly, cdc13-2 pif1-m2 telomeres are approximately wild-type in length, albeit more heterogeneous, and stable throughout the course of the experiment (Figure 1B). Our findings indicate that telomerase-mediated telomere extension can occur in cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells, allowing cells to maintain telomere length homeostasis and avoid replicative senescence. Because the strains used for this experiment have an unusual genotype (Table 1), relevant for our previous study (Strecker et al. 2017) but not for this study, we performed all subsequent experiments in a different strain background (W303), where none of the genes were overexpressed., cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells do not senesce and have telomeres that are stable in length. (A) Strains of the indicated genotypes were passaged four times on YPD plates after counter selection on 5-FOA to remove plasmid YEp24-CDC13. Each passage corresponds to ∼25 generations of growth. (B) Telomere Southern blot analysis of strains from A. The black arrowhead indicates a 1.8-kb DNA fragment generated from the BsmAI-digestion of plasmid pYt103 loaded as a control., cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells do not senesce and have telomeres that are stable in length.

(B) Telomere Southern blot analysis of strains from A. The black arrowhead indicates a 1.8-kb DNA fragment generated from the BsmAI-digestion of plasmid pYt103 loaded as a control., We hypothesized that the yKu-TLC1 pathway may become essential for telomere length homeostasis in cdc13-2 pif1-m2 strains. To test this possibility, haploid meiotic progeny derived from the sporulation of CDC13/cdc13-2 PIF1/pif1-m2 YKU80/yku80-135i and CDC13/cdc13-2 PIF1/pif1-m2 TLC1/tlc1Δ48 heterozygous diploids were serially propagated in liquid culture for several days (Figure 2, A and B). The yku80-135i and tlc1Δ48 alleles disrupt the interaction between the yKu complex and TLC1 (Peterson et al. 2001; Stellwagen et al. 2003). As expected, cdc13-2 cultures grew slower as the experiment progressed and cells senesced, but growth was eventually restored upon the emergence of survivors that utilize recombination-mediated mechanisms to maintain telomeres (Lendvay et al. 1996). In contrast, the cdc13-2 pif1-m2 strains did not senesce, confirming our previous observations in a different strain background (S288C for strains used in Figure 1 as opposed to W303 for all other strains used in this study). The cdc13-2 pif1-m2 yku80-135i and cdc13-2 pif1-m2 tlc1Δ48 triple mutants showed a pattern of senescence and survivor formation, indicating that the yKu-TLC1 telomerase recruitment pathway is required for telomere length homeostasis in cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells. The yku80-135i and tlc1Δ48Δ alleles caused cdc13-2 and cdc13-2 pif1-m2 strains to senesce faster, but the reason for this is currently unclear., Telomeres are maintained by the yKu-TLC1 pathway in cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells. Senescence was monitored in liquid culture by serial passaging of haploid meiotic progeny derived from the sporulation of VSY20 (A), VSY7 (B), EFSY142 (C), EFSY73 (D), FRY867 (E), CAY2 (F), and MCY815 (G).

Senescence was monitored in liquid culture by serial passaging of haploid meiotic progeny derived from the sporulation of VSY20 (A), VSY7 (B), EFSY142 (C), EFSY73 (D), FRY867 (E), CAY2 (F), and MCY815 (G). Average cell density ±SEM of 3–9 independent isolates per genotype (except n = 2 for cdc13-F237A, E252K) is plotted., The abundance of TLC1 RNA is reduced to ∼30% and ∼48% in yku80-135i and tlc1Δ48 mutants, respectively, compared with wild-type cells (Zappulla et al. 2011). In addition, disrupting the yKu-TLC1 interaction causes mislocalization of TLC1 to the cytoplasm (Gallardo et al. 2008; Pfingsten et al. 2012). It is possible that reduced abundance and/or mislocalization of TLC1, rather than disruption of the yKu-TLC1 telomerase recruitment pathway, is responsible for the senescence of cdc13-2 pif1-m2 yku80-135i and cdc13-2 pif1-m2 tlc1Δ48 triple mutants. Sir4 is also required for the yKu-TLC1 recruitment pathway, but deletion of SIR4 does not affect TLC1 abundance (Hass and Zappulla 2015), and there is no evidence that sir4Δ affects TLC1 localization. We find that cdc13-2 pif1-m2 sir4Δ triple mutants also senesce (Figure 2C), although the “dip” in the senescence curve was more shallow (note the difference in scale on the y-axis). The shallow dip is consistent across multiple isolates of cdc13-2 pif1-m2 sir4Δ (nine isolates) as well as cdc13-2 sir4Δ (six isolates). The presence of the shallow dip in cdc13-2 sir4Δ indicates that this effect is due to sir4Δ, and is unrelated to the pif1-m2 suppression of cdc13-2 senescence. This effect of sir4Δ has also been observed with respect to the senescence of mre11Δ yku80Δ double mutants, which was attributed to increased recombination and amplification of Y′ subtelomeric elements (Liu et al. 2021). While these experiments leave open the possibility that reduced abundance and/or mislocalization of TLC1 plays a role in the senescence of cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells with an additional yku80-135i, tlc1Δ48, or sir4Δ mutation, the simplest interpretation of our findings is that recruitment of telomerase via the yKu-TLC1 pathway is indeed required for telomere length homeostasis in cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells., Combining mutations that disrupt the Cdc13EBM-N–Est1 interaction (e.g., cdc13-F237A) and the yKu-TLC1 interaction leads to replicative senescence (Chen et al. 2018). We tested whether the pif1-m2 mutation could suppress this replicative senescence and found that it can: cdc13-F237A tlc1Δ48 strains senesce while cdc13-F237A pif1-m2 tlc1Δ48 strains do not (Figure 2D). Similarly, pif1-m2 can suppress replicative senescence of a cdc13-F237A, E252K mutant that disrupts both the Cdc13EBM-N and Cdc13EBM-C motifs (Figure 2E)., In summary, these findings indicate that mutation of PIF1 allows sufficient telomerase recruitment to avoid replicative senescence caused by disruption of the Cdc13EBM-C–Est1 interaction alone, or double disruption of both the Cdc13EBM-N–Est1 and yKu–TLC1 interactions. However, suppression is not possible when both the Cdc13EBM-C–Est1 and yKu–TLC1 interactions are abolished. Disruption of both the Cdc13EBM-N–Est1 and Cdc13EBM-C–Est1 interactions can be suppressed by mutation of PIF1 (Figure 2E), suggesting that the Cdc13EBM-N–Est1 interaction plays a more minor role, likely in support of the Cdc13EBM-C–Est1 interaction. Our findings suggest that Pif1 inhibits telomerase regardless of how telomerase is recruited: mutation of PIF1 in cdc13-2 cells allows increased telomerase recruitment via the yKu-TLC1 pathway, while mutation of PIF1 in cdc13-F237A tlc1Δ48 cells allows increased telomerase recruitment via the Cdc13EBM-C-Est1 pathway., The cdc13-2 mutation greatly reduces the recruitment of Est1 to telomeres (Chan et al. 2008), and the expression of Cdc13-Est2 fusion protein allows cells to stably maintain their telomeres in the absence of Est1 (Evans and Lundblad 1999). Therefore, it was possible that pif1-m2 suppresses the replicative senescence caused by cdc13-2 by somehow bypassing the need for Est1 for telomerase-mediated telomere extension. To test this idea, we sporulated an EST1/est1Δ PIF1/pif1-m2 heterozygous diploid and monitored growth of the haploid meiotic progeny (Figure 2F). We find that est1Δ pif1-m2 double mutants senesce like est1Δ single mutants, indicating that mutation of PIF1 cannot bypass the need for Est1., Because the cdc13-2 mutation normally results in a complete defect in telomerase-mediated telomere extension, it has not been possible to perform classical genetic epistasis experiments to determine which telomere length regulators act through the Cdc13EBM-C-Est1 pathway. The viability and non-senescence of cdc13-2 pif1-m2 strains give us the opportunity to do so. The Rap1-interacting factors, Rif1 and Rif2, negatively regulate telomerase (Hardy et al. 1992; Wotton and Shore 1997) while the Tel1 kinase is a positive regulator (Greenwell et al. 1995). We measured the telomere length of haploid strains propagated for over 100 population doublings after being generated from the sporulation of heterozygous diploids (Figure 3A). We find that cdc13-2 pif1-m2 cells have short telomeres, which is in contrast to the more wild-type, but heterogeneous, length telomeres shown in Figure 1. The difference is most likely due to different genetic backgrounds (strains in Figure 1 are of the S288C background, with an additional deletion of RAD52, while all other strains used in this study are of the W303 background; Table 1), but not due to cdc13-2 being expressed from a high-copy plasmid in Figure 1, because overexpression of neither CDC13 nor cdc13-2 affects telomere length (Figure 3B). While deletion of RIF1 elongates cdc13-2 pif1-m2 telomeres, both cdc13-2 pif1-m2 rif2Δ and cdc13-2 pif1-m2 tel1Δ triple mutants have very similar telomere lengths compared with cdc13-2 pif1-m2, indicating that Rif2 and Tel1 function upstream and in the same pathway as the Cdc13EBM-C motif (Figure 3). Our results are consistent with previous observations showing that tel1Δ is epistatic to rif2Δ in terms of telomere length, while the relationship between Tel1 and Rif1 is more complex and telomere-specific (Craven and Petes 1999; Sholes et al. 2021)., The cdc13-2 allele is epistatic to rif2Δ and tel1Δ with respect to telomere length regulation in a pif1-m2 background. Telomere Southern blot analysis of strains of the indicated genotypes. All strains were propagated for at least 100 population doublings before Southern blot analysis.

The black arrowhead indicates a 1.8-kb DNA fragment generated from the BsmAI-digestion of plasmid pYt103 loaded as a control., Tel1 often functions in concert with a related kinase, Mec1. Mutation of both MEC1 and TEL1 results in an est phenotype (Ritchie et al. 1999). Because Tel1 promotes telomerase activity through the Cdc13EBM-C–Est1 interaction, we examined whether the same is true for Mec1. If so, the replicative senescence of mec1 tel1 double mutants, like cdc13-2, should also be suppressed by pif1-m2. We sporulated a MEC1/mec1-21 TEL1/tel1Δ PIF1/pif1-m2 diploid strain and monitored the growth of the mec1-21 tel1Δ and mec1-21 tel1Δ pif1-m2 haploid meiotic progeny. Both strains exhibited a similar rate of senescence (Figure 2G), indicating that pif1-m2 cannot suppress the est phenotype of a mec1 tel1 double mutant, and that Mec1 functions in a different pathway than Tel1 to promote telomerase activity, as previously proposed (Ritchie et al. 1999; Keener et al. 2019)., In summary, our findings provide new insight into how telomerase is recruited to telomeres in S. cerevisiae. Further work is needed to determine how the Cdc13EBM-C motif functions, what its relationship is with the Cdc13EBM-N motif, and the role of Tel1 in promoting telomerase recruitment., Strains and plasmids are available upon request.

Even though significant additive genetic variation was observed for LD and EM, the phenotypic ranges were comparatively narrow and genome-wide analyses did not identify any large-effect loci. Genomic selection (GS) accuracy ranged from 0.28 to 0.59 for LD and 0.37 to 0.47 for EM. Additive genetic correlations between fruit quality and gray mold resistance traits were consistent with prevailing hypotheses: LD decreased as titratable acidity increased, whereas EM increased as soluble solid content decreased and firmness increased. We concluded that phenotypic and GS could be effective for reducing LD and increasing EM, especially in long shelf life populations, but that a significant fraction of the genetic variation for resistance to gray mold was caused by the pleiotropic effects of fruit quality traits that differ among market and shelf life classes.","Fragaria × ananassa, Botrytis cinerea, breeding, necrotroph, genome-wide association study, disease resistance, whole-genome regression","Gray mold, a disease of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) caused by the ubiquitous necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, renders fruit unmarketable and causes economic losses in the postharvest supply chain. To explore the feasibility of selecting for increased resistance to gray mold, we undertook genetic and genomic prediction studies in strawberry populations segregating for fruit quality and shelf life traits hypothesized to pleiotropically affect susceptibility. As predicted, resistance to gray mold was heritable but quantitative and genetically complex. While every individual was susceptible, the speed of symptom progression and severity differed. Narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.38 to 0.71 for lesion diameter (LD) and 0.39 to 0.44 for speed of emergence of external mycelium (EM).

We concluded that phenotypic and GS could be effective for reducing LD and increasing EM, especially in long shelf life populations, but that a significant fraction of the genetic variation for resistance to gray mold was caused by the pleiotropic effects of fruit quality traits that differ among market and shelf life classes., The fleshy fruits produced by strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and many other horticulturally important plants are susceptible to postharvest decay by gray mold, a devastating disease caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (Jarvis 1962; van Baarlen et al. 2007; Williamson et al. 2007; Dean et al. 2012; Elad et al. 2016; Petrasch et al. 2019a). Botrytis cinerea can infect most organs of the plant but is especially destructive on ripe fruit and senescent tissues of dicotyledonous hosts (Jarvis 1962; Dewey and Grant-Downton 2016). Gray mold renders strawberries unmarketable and often causes significant postharvest losses under conditions favorable for pathogen growth (Barritt 1980; Ries 1995; Dean et al. 2012; Petrasch et al. 2019a). The mechanisms of defense against B. cinerea are physiologically and genetically complex and markedly differ from the gene-for-gene resistance and programmed cell death mechanisms commonly triggered by biotrophic pathogens (Elad and Evensen 1995; Glazebrook 2005; Lorang 2019; Caseys et al. 2021). As with other necrotrophic pathogens, B. cinerea pathogenesis is promoted by fruit ripening and host cell death (Elad and Evensen 1995; Elad et al. 2016; Lorang 2019). Consequently, genetic variation for resistance to gray mold tends to be subtle, limited, and quantitative, which undoubtedly underlies the paucity of studies on breeding for resistance to this pathogen (Finkers et al. 2007a; Williamson et al. 2007; Rowe and Kliebenstein 2008; Lorang 2019; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021)., Because natural genetic resistance has been insufficient to prevent postharvest gray mold disease development, preharvest fungicides are often applied to suppress pathogen growth and minimize postharvest losses (Legard et al. 1997, 2005; Leroux 2007; Elad et al. 2016; Cosseboom et al. 2019). Controlling B. cinerea with fungicides is difficult because the airborne inoculum is present year round, the host–pathogen interactions are complicated, and the pathogen rapidly evolves resistance to fungicides, particularly after repeated applications of specific chemicals (Jarvis 1962; Leroux 2007; Williamson et al. 2007; Cosseboom et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021). Moreover, preharvest foliar applications of fungicides have not been shown to be effective for reducing postharvest gray mold incidence in strawberry fruit possibly because many fruit infections arise from contaminated flower tissues (van Kan 2006; van Baarlen et al. 2007; Williamson et al. 2007; Veloso and van Kan 2018; Petrasch et al. 2019a)., The development of gray mold resistant cultivars has been challenging in strawberry and other hosts because most genotypes are highly susceptible, strong sources of natural genetic resistance have not been identified, and resistance mechanisms are quantitative (Barritt 1980; van Kan 2006; Finkers et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2008; Williamson et al. 2007; Seijo et al. 2008; Lewers et al. 2012; Petrasch et al. 2019a; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021). The feasibility of selecting for increased resistance to gray mold has not been deeply explored in strawberry, a species where limited studies have been undertaken to shed light on the genetics of resistance and assess genetic variation for resistance (Barritt 1980; Seijo et al. 2008; Lewers et al. 2012). The problem of breeding for resistance to gray mold has been most extensively studied in tomato, albeit without achieving robust or foolproof solutions (Finkers et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2008). Genetic studies in tomato and Arabidopsis leaves have identified multiple small-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) that only account for a small fraction of the genetic variation for resistance, seldom translate across genetic backgrounds, and have not solved the problem of breeding for resistance to gray mold (,Finkers et al. 2007a, ,2007b, 2008; ,Rowe and Kliebenstein 2008,). Although genetic studies of similar depth and breadth have not been undertaken in strawberry, previous studies have not uncovered strong sources of resistance to gray mold (,Barritt 1980,; ,Bestfleisch et al. 2015,; ,Seijo et al. 2008,; ,Lewers et al. 2012,)., We suspected that selection for increased fruit firmness and other fruit quality traits that extend shelf life pleiotropically increased resistance (decreased susceptibility) to gray mold in strawberry. While hypotheses can be formulated from insights gained from genetic studies in tomato and other hosts (Blanco-Ulate et al. 2016a, 2016b; Petrasch et al. 2019b; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021), natural genetic resistance appears to be negligible and quantitative and additive genetic correlations between gray mold resistance and fruit quality phenotypes are unknown in strawberry (Jarvis 1962; Rhainds et al. 2002; Chandler et al. 2006; Seijo et al. 2008; González et al. 2009; Lewers et al. 2012; González et al. 2013; Bestfleisch et al. 2015; Petrasch et al. 2019a). The susceptibility of strawberry fruit to B. cinerea increases during ripening (Jarvis 1962), which suggests that susceptibility factors accumulate independent of defense mechanisms during fruit maturation and senescence, as is typical for this necrotroph (Williamson et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021; Silva et al. 2021). Changes in fruit firmness and other fruit quality traits associated with fruit maturation and ripening in tomato have been shown to increase susceptibility to B. cinerea (Blanco-Ulate et al. 2016a, 2016b; Silva et al. 2021). Although previous studies have been somewhat inconclusive in strawberry, firm-fruited cultivars are predicted to be more resistant to B. cinerea than soft-fruited cultivars (Gooding 1976; Barritt 1980). Moreover, ripening-induced differences in proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin accumulation have been predicted to affect B. cinerea resistance in tomato and strawberry (Jersch et al. 1989; Zhang et al. 2013; Bassolino et al. 2013)., To more deeply explore the genetics of resistance to gray mold and assess the feasibility of applying genomic selection (GS) for increased resistance to gray mold in strawberry, we developed and studied training populations segregating for fruit quality traits predicted to affect shelf life. Genomic prediction approaches are particularly attractive for postharvest traits that are difficult and costly to phenotype in strawberry but still require sufficient accuracy to complement phenotypic selection and achieve genetic gains (Heffner et al. 2010; Jannink et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2014; VanRaden 2020). The training populations for our studies were developed from crosses between firm-fruited long shelf life (LSL) cultivars and soft-fruited short shelf life (SSL) cultivars. Although the gray mold resistance phenotypes of the parents of these populations were unknown, our hypothesis was that selection for extended shelf life has pleiotropically increased resistance to gray mold in strawberry, primarily because fruit of LSL cultivars deteriorate more slowly in postharvest storage than those of SSL cultivars. We describe a highly repeatable artificial inoculation protocol for gray mold resistance phenotyping developed for the GS studies described herein. Finally, we discuss the prospects for increasing genetic gains for resistance to gray mold through the application of genomic prediction approaches., Shelf life studies were conducted with fruit harvested from five day-neutral cultivars (“UCD Royal Royce,” “UCD Valiant,” “UCD Moxie,” “Cabrillo,” and “Monterey”) and three “summer-plant” (“UCD Finn,” “UCD Mojo,” and “Portola”) cultivars (the “UCD” prefixes are hereafter dropped from the cultivar names) grown on organic and conventional farms using the standard production practices of commercial growers in coastal California. The day-neutral cultivars were grown in 20-plant plots on three commercial farms, one organic and two conventional, in Santa Maria and Prunedale, California in 2017–2018 with harvests for postharvest studies on June 22 and 27, July 30, and August 1, 2018, July 30, 2018. The summer-plant cultivars were grown in 20-plant plots on three commercial farms, one organic and two conventional, in Oxnard and Santa Maria, CA in 2018–2019 with harvests for postharvest studies on September 27 and 30, November 1 and 18, and December 4, 2019., To assess shelf life and estimate gray mold incidence, fruit was harvested on two dates at each location and stored in a dark walk-in cooler maintained at approximately 4°C and 90–95% relative humidity for 21 days postharvest (dph). Harvest dates were June 22 and 27, July 30, and August 1, 2018, for day-neutral cultivars and September 27 and 30, November 1, 18, and 21, and December 4, 2019, for summer-plant cultivars. Two 0.45 kg samples of fruit were collected at each harvest and placed in 18.4 cm × 12.1 cm × 6.2 cm vented plastic clamshells, one of which was stored undisturbed for visual phenotyping and another of which was used for destructive fruit quality trait measurements at three time points for summer-plant experiment (0, 7, and 14 dph) and four time points for the day-neutral experiment (0, 7, 14, and 21 dph). Soluble solid content (SSC; °Brix), fruit firmness (g-force), fruit weight (g/fruit), fungal decay incidence (% of clamshell), and marketability were recorded at each time point. The latter was visually scored on a 1–5 scale, where 1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, and 5 = very poor (Mitcham et al. 1996; do Nascimento Nunes 2015). Four fruit were randomly selected from each clamshell at each time point for fruit firmness and SSC measurements. Firmness was measured using a handheld penetrometer (QA Supplies Model FT02) with a 3 mm probe. SSC (°Brix) was measured in the juice of macerated fruit with a digital handheld refractometer (Atago Model PAL-1). Statistical analyses of these experiments were separately performed using the R package lme4 (Bates et al. 2015) with cultivar as a fixed effect and with location and cultivar × location interaction as random effects. Estimated marginal means (EMMs) and linear contrasts between cultivar EMMs were estimated using the R package emmeans (Lenth 2021)., Seeds of five F. × ananassa full-sib families were harvested from crosses produced in a greenhouse at UC Davis in the winter of 2018: Royal Royce × Primella (PI551422), Royal Royce × Madame Moutot (PI551632), Royal Royce × Tangi (PI551481), Royal Royce × Earlimiss (PI551862), and 05C197P002 × 16C108P065. These families constituted the multifamily training population developed for genomic prediction and other analyses. Seeds were scarified and germinated the week of June 18–22, 2018. Seedlings were established and grown in a greenhouse until they were transplanted to the field on October 5, 2018, at the UC Davis Wolfskill Experiment Orchard (WEO), Winters, CA, USA. The field site was prepared with a disk-harrow and ring-roller and smoothed with a spring-tooth harrow. The soil was fumigated on May 14, 2018, with Pic-Clor 60® (1, 3-dichloropropene 39% and chloropicrin 59.6%; Cardinal Professional Products, Woodland, CA, USA) at a rate of 474.7 kg/ha. Subsequent to fumigation, planting beds were mechanically shaped to a height of 30.5 cm, width of 50.8 cm, base of 121.9 cm with center-to-center spacing of 152.4 cm between beds, and a furrow width of 30.5 cm. Seedlings were transplanted to planting beds on October 15, 2018, in a single-centered row with 55.9 cm between plants within the row. The number of individuals that produced sufficient fruit for the postharvest study of resistance to gray mold were n = 86 for Royal Royce × Primella, n = 82 for Royal Royce × Madame Moutot, n = 78 for Royal Royce × Tangi, n = 92 for Royal Royce × Earlimiss, and n = 42 for 05C197P002 × 16C108P065. The parents were planted from bare-root plants produced in a commercial high-elevation nursery in Dorris, CA, USA. The population was grown through June 30, 2019, irrigated as needed to prevent water stress, and hand weeded throughout the growing season. Fruit were harvested on from May 15 to June 7, 2019. Additional Royal Royce × Tangi full-sib individuals (n = 155) were grown, handled, and phenotyped in 2019–2020 exactly as described above for the 2018–2019 experiment (phenotypic data were collected for 233 Royal Royce × Tangi individuals over two years). Fruit were harvested May 8–29, 2020., DNA was extracted from 0.2 g of dried young leaf tissue with the E-Z 96 Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions, though the protocol was modified by adding Proteinase K to the lysis buffer to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and extending lysis incubation to 45 min. at 65°C to increase the quality and yield of the DNA. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using the 50K Axiom SNP array (Hardigan et al. 2020), and SNP calls were generated using the Affymetrix Axiom Suite (v1.1.1.66). The raw genotypic data were filtered to identify polymorphic SNP markers with clear and well separated homozygous and heterozygous genotypic classes and eliminate individual SNP markers with minor allele frequencies < 0.05 and any missing data. This process yielded 11,946 SNPs for the training population (n = 380) studied in 2019 and 9962 SNPs for the Royal Royce × Tangi full-sib population (n = 233) studied in 2019 and 2020., We developed a high-throughput protocol for postharvest phenotyping of B. cinerea disease progression and symptom development on ripe fruit. Spore suspensions of the B. cinerea strain B05.10 (Büttner et al. 1994; Quidde et al. 1998) were produced from spores grown on potato dextrose agar as described by Petrasch et al. (2019b). Uniformly ripe fruit were harvested at sunrise, avoiding fruit that were under- or over-ripe. The fruit were immediately transferred to cold storage (2.5°C) and inoculated the day of harvest. Several incubation temperatures (2.5°C, 5.0°C, 10.0°C, and 20.0°C) were tested to identify the optimum temperature for B. cinerea growth and development with a minimum of contamination from other postharvest decay pathogens. Fruit were placed on 30-cell plastic egg hatching trays with dimensions of 29 cm × 29 cm and 4.5 cm × 4.5 cm cells. The fruit were punctured once near the center with a 3 mm sterile pipette tip to an approximate depth of 1–2 mm. Ten μl of the B. cinerea conidia suspension (500 conidia/μl) was placed on the surface of the puncture. The inoculated fruit were incubated in a growth chamber at 10°C and 95% humidity for 14 days. Disease symptoms were assessed daily after inoculation by manually measuring lesion diameter (LD) and determining the number of days until external mycelium (EM; white or gray hyphae) was evident on the surface of the fruit near the wound site. Fruit were phenotyped until mycelia covered the entire surface of the fruit. Spoiled fruit with infections outside of the inoculation site or caused by decay organisms other than B. cinerea were removed from the experiment. Genome-wide association study (GWAS), QTL mapping, and GS analyses were applied to LD at 8 days postinoculation (dpi) and EM., Fruit quality phenotypes were measured on one to four fruit harvested from individuals in the multifamily population at harvest. The fruit were photographed with a Sony α 6000 camera equipped with an E PZ 16–50 mm F3.5–5.6 OSS lens (SONY, Tokyo, Japan). Photographs were processed with a custom macro in Fiji (Schindelin et al. 2012; Rueden et al. 2017) to obtain RGB color metrics (Supplementary File S1). RGB colors were subsequently converted into Lab colors using the convertColor() function in R (R Core Team 2021). Fruit firmness (maximum resistance g-force) and fruit diameter (mm) were assessed on whole fruit using a TA.XT plus Texture Analyzer with a TA-53 3 mm puncture probe (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Goldaming, United Kingdom). Fruit samples were frozen at −20°C in Whirl-Pak® Homogenizer Blender Filter Bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) for quantifying titrable acidity (TA; %), SSC (°BRIX), and total anthocyanin concentration (AC; μg/ml). TA percentages were quantified with a Metrohm Robotic Titrosampler System from 1 to 5 ml of the defrosted homogenized fruit juice (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland). SSC was measured from approximately 200 µl of juice on an RX-5000α-Bev Refractometer (ATAGO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Total AC was measured from a 25 µl sample of juice in 200 µl 1% HCl in methanol by reading absorption at a wavelength of 520 nm on a Synergy HTX platereader equipped with Gen5 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, California, USA). A standard curve (⁠y=sx+i⁠) was calculated for quantifying AC using a dilution series of pelargonidin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) from 0 to 300 µg/ml in 50 µg/ml increments, where y was absorption readings for the perlagonin dilution series, s was the slope, x was the concentration of perlagonin in the dilution series, and i was the intercept. AC was estimated by (A−i)/s⁠, where A was the absorption reading., GWAS approaches were applied to search for marker-trait associations in the multifamily training population and the Royal Royce × Tangi population. EMMs for LD and EM were estimated from subsamples and biological replications using the R package emmeans (Lenth 2021). GWAS analyses were applied using the GWAS() function in the R package rrBLUP with SNP genotypes (AA, Aa, and aa) coded −1, 0, and 1, respectively (Endelman 2011). The genomic relationship matrix was used to correct for population stratification (Endelman 2011). The genomic inflation factor (λ) was 0.60 for LD and 0.71 for EM for analyses of the multifamily population and 1.09 for LD and 1.00 for EM for analyses of the Royal Royce × Tangi population. The Bonferroni-corrected threshold for statistical significance was −log10(0.05/k) where k is the number of SNPs used in the analysis. The Bonferroni-corrected threshold was −log10(4.2 × 106) for the multifamily population and −log10(5.0 × 106) for the Royal Royce × Tangi population., Parent-specific genetic maps were developed for each full-sib family using a custom PERL script pipeline utilizing the R packages BatchMap and onemap (Schiffthaler et al. 2017; Margarido et al. 2007; Supplementary File S4). This pipeline was used to bin co-segregating markers, calculate pairwise recombination fractions, assign markers to linkage groups, and estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistics between groups of markers. Specifically, initial linkage groups (representing chromosomal fragments or sub-linkage groups) were assembled using a LOD threshold of 10.0 and a maximum recombination fraction of 0.08. These thresholds typically generate more linkage groups that chromosomes. These chromosomal fragments or sub-linkage groups were then merged manually based on inter-group linkage disequilibrium statistics and %-identity against the physical genome (Edger et al. 2019). The RECORD algorithm (Van Os et al. 2005) was used to estimate marker order and genetic distances across a sliding window of 25 markers with a window overlap of 18 markers., QTL analyses were applied to parent-specific genetic maps within each full-sib family using the scanone() function and Haley–Knott regression (Haley and Knott 1992) as implemented in the R package qtl (Broman et al. 2003). The null hypothesis of no significant difference between SNP marker genotypes was tested for each locus using backcross equivalent contrasts; specifically, y¯Aa−y¯aa for SNP markers segregating in the female parent and y¯aa−y¯Aa for SNP markers segregating in the male parent, where Aa is a heterozygote and aa is a homozygote. The null hypothesis of no QTL effect was rejected when the likelihood odds (LOD) ratio for the SNP marker effect exceeded the genome-wide LOD significance threshold empirically estimated by permutation with 1000 randomly drawn samples (Churchill and Doerge 1994)., We searched the F. × ananassa “Camarosa” reference genome (Edger et al. 2019) for QTL-associated candidate genes with putative biotic stress or disease resistance gene function annotations. Gene Ontology annotations were filtered to identify candidate genes predicted to be involved in plant–pathogen interactions. Candidate genes were annotated using the KEGG Automated Annotation Server (KAAS; Moriya et al. 2007) pipeline and filtered pathways. The iTAK pipeline was used to predict the presence of transcription factors and protein kinases (Zheng et al. 2016)., The repeatability on a progeny mean-basis (R) was estimated for each trait from multiple subsamples/individual (fruit/individual) by R=σB2/(σB2+σW2/s¯⁠), where σB2 is the between-individual variance component, σW2 is the among subsamples nested in individuals variance component, s¯ is the harmonic mean number of subsamples/individual, and s¯ was 2.4 in the multifamily population and 3.6 in the Royal Royce × Tangi population. Variance components were estimated using REML in the R package lme4 (Bates et al. 2015). Narrow-sense genomic heritability (h2) was estimated for each trait from the mean of 1000 REML estimates of the additive genetic and phenotypic variance components from 1000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples drawn for cross-validation using G-BLUP (Endelman 2011)., Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) were estimated for each trait by applying three whole-genome regression methods in both training populations—genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), and support vector machine (SVM). G-BLUP, RKHS, and SVM mixed model analyses were performed using the kinBLUP() function of rrBLUP (Endelman 2011), the BGLR() function of the R package BGLR (Pérez and de Los Campos 2014), and the svm() function of R package e1071 (Meyer et al. 2019), respectively. The kernel for RKHS was determined using the multikernel averaging method (de Los Campos et al. 2010). Cross-validation analyses were performed for each population × trait × whole-genome regression (WGR) method using 1000 MCMC samples/analysis, where GEBVs were estimated from a random sample of 80% of the individuals and predicted for the GEBVs for the other 20% of the individuals in each sample; 100% of the subsamples/individual were used for these analyses. We replicated these cross-validation analyses using a single randomly selected subsample/individual, where GEBVs were estimated from a random sample of 80% of the individuals (with a single subsample/individual) and predicted the GEBVs for the other 20% of the individuals. GS accuracy was estimated for each of the nine analyses as the correlation between the phenotypic means (EMMs) and GEBVs (⁠ry¯,GEBV⁠) for each trait from 1000 MCMC samples/analysis., Our studies were partly motivated by the observation that gray mold infections were uncommon between 0 and 14 dpi in a series of postharvest shelf life studies of modern LSL strawberry cultivars (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S1). The fruit for these studies were harvested from five day-neutral cultivars (“Royal Royce,” “Valiant” “Moxie” “Cabrillo,” and “Monterey”) and three summer-plant cultivars (“Finn,” “Mojo” and “Portola”) grown on commercial farms in coastal California (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S1). These studies produced several insights. Gray mold infections were rarely observed before 14–16 dph on any of the cultivars tested (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S1). Statistically significant differences in gray mold incidence were not observed among day-neutral cultivars (P = 0.87) or summer-plant cultivars (P = 0.98) or between organically and conventionally produced fruit (P = 0.27 for day-neutral and P = 0.68 for summer-plant cultivars). Cultivar × location interactions were nonexistent—REML estimates of the cultivar × environment interaction variance component were zero in both studies (P = 1)., Postharvest visual appearance of cold stored fruit of LSL day-neutral cultivars grown in coastal California. Fruit of “Royal Royce,” “Valiant,” “Moxie,” “Cabrillo,” and “Monterey” were harvested June 22 and 27, July 30, and August 1, 2018 from commercial farms in Santa Maria and Prunedale, California, immediately cooled, stored undisturbed in 0.45 kg clamshells at 4°C and 90–95% relative humidity for 21 dph, and photographed and phenotyped 0, 7, 14, and 21 dph (lefthand panel). EMMs for gray mold incidence (%) were estimated and plotted and exponential regressions were fit to the original phenotypic observations (right panel). R2 estimates for goodness-of-fit of the exponential functions were 0.59 for Cabrillo, 0.22 for Monterey, 0.25 for Moxie, 0.25 for Royal Royce, and 0.50 for Valiant., Postharvest visual appearance of cold stored fruit of LSL day-neutral cultivars grown in coastal California. Fruit of “Royal Royce,” “Valiant,” “Moxie,” “Cabrillo,” and “Monterey” were harvested June 22 and 27, July 30, and August 1, 2018 from commercial farms in Santa Maria and Prunedale, California, immediately cooled, stored undisturbed in 0.45 kg clamshells at 4°C and 90–95% relative humidity for 21 dph, and photographed and phenotyped 0, 7, 14, and 21 dph (lefthand panel). EMMs for gray mold incidence (%) were estimated and plotted and exponential regressions were fit to the original phenotypic observations (right panel). R2 estimates for goodness-of-fit of the exponential functions were 0.59 for Cabrillo, 0.22 for Monterey, 0.25 for Moxie, 0.25 for Royal Royce, and 0.50 for Valiant., Gray mold incidence ranged from 0.0% to 2.7% among cultivars at 14 dph, a typical postharvest storage duration for LSL cultivars. The five day-neutral cultivars were screened out to 21 dph to develop insights into the postharvest storage limits for modern LSL cultivars (Figure 1). Although the fruit were still marketable at 14 dph, they became marginally marketable or unmarketable by 17–18 dph (Figure 1). We observed an exponential increase in gray mold incidence beyond 17–18 dph for every cultivar with means ranging from 10.3% to 36.7% among day-neutral cultivars at 21 dph. These studies showed that gray mold was ubiquitous and eventually rendered the fruit unmarketable but that the natural incidence of gray mold was negligible on fruit of LSL cultivars grown in coastal California within the 14 dph storage window (Figure 1; Supplementary File S2)., From common knowledge and earlier surveys of phenotypic diversity for resistance to gray mold (Gooding 1976; Barritt 1980; Lewers et al. 2012), we hypothesized that the low incidence of gray mold on commercially produced fruit of LSL cultivars might be genetically correlated with fruit firmness and other fruit quality traits affecting shelf life (Figure 2). Although phenotypic correlations have been reported (Barritt 1980), genetic correlations have not. The fruit of LSL cultivars are typically much firmer than the fruit of SSL cultivars commonly grown for local or direct-market consumption, as exemplified by Earlimiss, Madame Moutot, and Primella in the present study (Figure 2). The latter are sweeter, softer, and perish more rapidly than “Royal Royce” and other LSL cultivars under normal postharvest storage conditions (Figure 2). To explore how these phenotypic differences affect resistance to gray mold, we developed a training population (n = 380) for GS studies by crossing “Royal Royce,” one of the LSL cultivars assessed for natural infections (Figure 1), with four SSL cultivars (“Earlimiss,” “Madame Moutot,” “Primella,” and “Tangi”), in addition to crossing a pair of LSL parents with differences in fruit firmness and AC (05C197P002 × 16C108P065). These full-sib families were phenotyped for resistance to gray mold using an artificial inoculation protocol and genotyped with a 50K Axiom SNP array (Hardigan et al. 2020)., Fruit phenotypes for training population parents.

To overcome this problem, we developed a highly repeatable artificial inoculation protocol for gray mold resistance phenotyping that involved puncturing fruit with a 3-mm probe, propagating spores of a single B. cinerea strain (B05.10), introducing a known concentration of spores into the wound site, and monitoring disease development on individual fruit stored undisturbed under high humidity (Figure 3). Two quantitative B. cinerea disease symptoms were recorded on multiple fruits harvested from training population individuals: water-soaked LD in mm and the number of dpi when EM was observed on the surface of the fruit. We found that incubating artificially inoculated fruit at 10°C and 95% humidity in the dark yielded highly repeatable results with minimal contamination from other postharvest decay pathogens. LD and EM were recorded daily from 1 to 14 dpi (Figures 3 and 4). This protocol produced highly reproducible results with repeatability estimates in the 0.66–0.83 range for LD and 0.68–0.71 range for EM (Table 1). Although critical for maximizing repeatability, this protocol produced more severe disease symptoms than those commonly observed from ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Narrow-sense genomic heritability was estimated for 100% of the subsamples (⁠s¯=2.9⁠) and for a single randomly selected subsample/individual (⁠s¯=1.0⁠) in both populations, where s¯ is the harmonic mean number of subsamples/individual., Repeatability (r) and narrow-sense genomic heritability (h2) estimates for gray mold LD and speed of emergence of EM, Statistics were estimated for n = 380 individuals and s = 1, 520 subsamples in a multifamily population and n = 233 individuals and s = 1, 386 subsamples in the Royal Royce × Tangi population.

The speed of fungal development and symptom severity differed among individuals in both populations (Figure 4). The phenotypic extremes we observed are illustrated in time-series photographs of four individuals from the upper and lower tails of the LD and EM distributions in the multifamily population (Figure 3). Lesions became visible and had enlarged to 10.0 mm by 5 dpi in one of the most susceptible individuals (18C346P030), whereas lesions were not visible until 8 dpi and developed the slowest in one of the least susceptible individuals (18C346P032). Lesions spanned the entire fruit surface of the most susceptible individuals by 8 dpi, thereby resulting in significant postharvest fruit deterioration and fungal decay (Figure 3). Consequently, our genetic analyses of LD were applied to phenotypes observed 8 dpi, the last day in the study that resistance phenotypes could be observed for every individual., As expected, our analyses confirmed that resistance to gray mold is genetically complex in strawberry, a finding consistent with observations in other hosts (Lurie et al. 1997; Glazebrook 2005; Rowe and Kliebenstein 2008; Lewers et al. 2012; Corwin et al. 2016; Hanson et al. 2016; Petrasch et al. 2019a; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021). Although statistically significant differences were observed among individuals for LD and EM in both populations (P < 0.01), every individual was susceptible and the phenotypic ranges were comparatively narrow (Figures 3 and 4). LDs were approximately normally distributed and ranged from 7.0 to 33.5 mm at 8 dpi in the multifamily population and 7.0 to 34.0 mm at 8 dpi in the Royal Royce × Tangi population (Figure 4; Supplementary Figure S2). Similarly, the speed of appearance of mycelium on the surface of the fruit (EM) was approximately normally distributed and ranged from 4.0 to 12.5 dpi in the multifamily population and 5.5 to 12.5 dpi in the Royal Royce × Tangi population (fruit were phenotyped out to 14 dpi). The repeatabilities for LD and EM among individuals in these populations suggested that two-thirds or more of the phenotypic variation observed for gray mold resistance was genetically caused (Table 1). Narrow-sense genomic heritability estimates ranged from 0.38 to 0.71 for LD and 0.39 to 0.44 for EM, which suggested that a significant fraction of the genetic variation was additive and thus that resistance to gray mold can be enhanced by artificial selection (Table 1)., LDs were plotted for every individual to visualize phenotypic changes in disease symptoms over time (Figure 4, A and B). The heatmap colors of the individual curves were determined from the LD EMM ranks at 8 dpi. These plots show that the speed of lesion development differed among individuals, that cross-over individual × time interactions were negligible, and that the phenotypic changes among individuals were approximately parallel over time, all of which increased confidence in the heritability of the phenotypic differences we observed (Table 1)., Genome-wide searches failed to identify large-effect loci for LD or EM (Figure 5; Table 2). These searches included GWAS in the training populations and QTL mapping in individual full-sib families. Nine family-specific QTL with small effects were identified, eight for LD and one for EM (Table 2). None had effects large enough to warrant targeting by marker-assisted selection or inclusion as fixed effects in genomic prediction models. Although the QTL effects were small and family specific (Table 2), a few interesting candidate gene associations were identified when short QTL-associated haploblocks were searched in the reference genome for genes with biotic stress and disease resistance annotations (Supplementary File S6). A cluster of 11 tandemly duplicated genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were found in close proximity to the most significant SNP (AX-184469645) associated with a QTL on chromosome 4A (Table 2). These genes share sequence homology to FcPR10, an Fragaria chiloensis ribonuclease encoding gene previously predicted to reduce the severity of gray mold disease in strawberry (González et al. 2009, 2013). The other QTL-associated candidate genes that might warrant further study encode peroxidases (chromosome 7D; Mb 576-2709) reported to modulate reactive oxygen species levels and inhibit fungal growth during B. cinerea infections (Cantu et al. 2008, 2009; Tomas-Grau et al. 2018) and transcription factors reported to signal pathogen-triggered immunity, e.g., WRKY and AP2/ERF (chromosome 3B; Mb 13,870–15,400; Gutterson and Reuber 2004; Bigeard et al. 2015), that might target pathogenicity factors, e.g., chitinases (van Schie and Takken 2014) and protease inhibitors (Hermosa et al. 2006; Billon-Grand et al. 2012). While these genes are worthwhile candidates for further study (González et al. 2009, 2013; Petrasch et al. 2019a), the effects of the associated QTL were too small and insignificant for direct selection (Table 2). This was, nevertheless, a first attempt to identify loci underlying resistance to B. cinerea in strawberry through a genome-wide search for genotype-to-phenotype associations in the octoploid genome (Supplementary File S6)., GWAS of gray mold resistance.

The favorable allele for LD decreased the EMM, whereas the favorable allele for EM increased the EMM., Royal Royce, the firm-fruited LSL parent, was more resistant to gray mold than the soft-fruited SSL parents (phenotypic distributions and parent EMMs for each full-sib family are shown in Supplementary Figure S2). Lesions were smaller and mycelium appeared later in Royal Royce than the other parents (resistance increased as LD decreased and EM increased). Royal Royce was the more resistant parent for both traits in the four full-sib families with that parent (Figure 2; Supplementary Figure S2). For the 05C197P002 × 16C108P065 full-sib family, 05C197P002 was more resistant than 16C108P065 for LD and vice versa for EM. The LD and EM differences were highly significant (⁠P≤0.01⁠) with individuals transgressing the phenotypic ranges of the parents (Supplementary Figure S2). Transgressive segregation was primarily bidirectional for both traits; however, the EM distributions for Royal Royce × Tangi and 05C197P002 × 16C108P065 were right-skewed toward more resistance (slower EM emergence) and lacked individuals in the lower tails distal to the more susceptible parent (Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggested that favorable alleles were transmitted by both parents for both traits and that favorable alleles for different loci segregated in most of the families., Genomic prediction accuracies for different WGR methods ranged from 0.28 to 0.47 for LD and 0.37 to 0.59 for EM when estimated by cross-validation from 100% of the subsamples (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3). The differences in accuracy among WGR methods for each trait-population combination ranged from 0.00 to 0.07. RKHS produced the highest accuracy for two of the trait-population combinations and was equal in accuracy to G-BLUP for the other two trait-population combinations. SVM often perfomed intermediate to both G-BLUP and RKHS. The prediction accuracy was greater for LD than EM in the Royal Royce × Tangi population, whereas the reverse was observed in the multifamily population. Using cross-validation with 100% of the subsamples, clear differences in prediction accuracy and shrinkage were observed between disease symptoms within and between populations (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3). The prediction accuracy for LD was markedly different between the multifamily and Royal Royce × Tangi populations. The GEBV range for LD in the multifamily population was half as wide (15.5–22.8) and the kernel density was flatter and more vertical than that observed in the Royal Royce × Tangi population (13.3–27.4; Supplementary Figure S3). Notably, the LD phenotypes of the most resistant individuals in the RR × Tangi population (those with the smallest LD means) were well predicted. Their EM phenotypes, however, were not as well predicted—the GEBV range for EM (6.8–9.2) was half that of the phenotypic range (5.5–10.7) and the kernel density distribution was flatter and more vertical (Supplementary Figure S3)., Genomic prediction accuracy for gray mold resistance, Statistics were estimated from analyses of n = 380 individuals and s = 1, 520 subsamples in a multifamily population and n = 233 individuals and s = 1, 386 subsamples in the Royal Royce × Tangi population.

Collectively, 2563 fruit were harvested and individually stored, tracked, and phenotyped in our study (Figure 4). Our expectation was that multiple fruit/individual was needed to more accurately estimate EMMs and GEBVs and nominally increase heritability. To assess the effect of subsamples on prediction accuracy and explore the feasibility of applying selection for resistance to gray mold from a single subsample/individual, GEBVs and prediction accuracies were estimated from a single randomly selected subsample/individual. We observed a significant decrease in narrow-sense genomic heritability for LD and EM in the single subsample analyses, e.g., h^2 decreased from 0.38 to 0.13 for LD and 0.39 to 0.16 for EM in the multifamily population (Table 1). Naturally, prediction accuracies plummeted in the single subsample analyses too (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3). This is clearly illustrated by the kernel density distributions for GS accuracy estimated for G-BLUP, RKHS, and SVM by cross-validation with a single subsample/individual (Supplementary Figure S3). GEBV ranges were narrower and kernel density distributions were flatter and more vertical for the single subsample vs multiple subsample analyses for LD and EM in both populations (Supplementary Figure S3). Hence, we concluded that breeding values cannot be accurately predicted without subsampling fruit., One of our working hypotheses was that selection for increased fruit firmness and other shelf life-associated fruit quality traits pleiotropically decreased susceptibility to gray mold in strawberry. The additive genetic correlations support this hypothesis and highlight between family differences driven by breeding history, the phenotypic diversity of the parents, and transgressive segregation (Figures 3 and 6; Supplementary Figure S2). The pairwise breeding value distributions further highlight the family structure and phenotypic diversity within and among families. The fruit size, firmness, and TA by LD and EM breeding value distributions for the only elite × elite family in our study (05C197P002 × 16C108P065) were distinct from the four elite × exotic families (Figure 6, A–D and I and J)., Additive genetic correlations (⁠r^A⁠).

The abbreviations for fruit quality traits are SSC, soluble solids content; AC, anthocyanin content; TA, titratable acidity., LD and EM were weakly negatively genetically correlated (⁠r^A=−0.21⁠) and weakly to strongly genetically correlated with fruit quality traits in directions predicted by our hypotheses. Because gray mold resistance increases as LD decreases and EM increases, signs of the additive genetic correlations have different interpretations for LD and EM and can be antagonistic or synergistic. The interpretation depends on the specific phenotypes targeted for a particular market, e.g., SSL vs LSL. LD was negatively genetic correlated with titratable acidity (⁠r^A=−0.41⁠) and positively genetically correlated with pH (⁠r^A=0.41⁠); hence, LD increased as titratable acidity decreased and pH increased (Figure 6, I and J). The effect of titratable acidity on resistance phenotypes was the motivation for screening additional individuals from the Royal Royce × Tangi family, which had a significant genetic variation for TA and yielded more accurate genomic predictions for LD than were observed in the multifamily population (Supplementary Figure S3). EM was more strongly positively genetically correlated with fruit size and firmness than LD and negatively genetically correlated with total soluble solids (Figure 6). EM increased (disease resistance increased) as BRIX decreased and fruit size and firmness increased. Hence, we found that mycelium developed faster on softer, sweeter, and smaller fruit than firmer, less sweet, and larger fruit, as is typical of Royal Royce and other modern LSL cultivars (Figures 1 and 2)., Finally, LD was weakly negatively genetically correlated with AC, whereas EM was uncorrelated with AC (Figure 6, G and H). Although the additive genetic correlation we observed between LD and AC was in the direction predicted by previous studies in strawberry and tomato (Jersch et al. 1989; Hébert et al. 2002; Bassolino et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013), LD only slightly decreased as AC increased (Figure 6)., Breeding for resistance to necrotrophic pathogens has been challenging in plants (Finkers et al. 2007a, 2007b; Williamson et al. 2007; Petrasch et al. 2019a; Lorang 2019; Delplace et al. 2020). The mechanisms of resistance to necrotrophic pathogens are more subtle, quantitative, and complex than those commonly observed for biotrophic pathogens that trigger pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered-immunity and effector-triggered immunity (Glazebrook 2005; Jones and Dangl 2006; Jones et al. 2016; Saijo et al. 2018; Lorang 2019; Zhang et al. 2019; Caseys et al. 2021). Our findings were well aligned with previous findings in other B. cinerea hosts and shed light on the genetic complexity of resistance to gray mold in strawberry. Where do we go from here? We are skeptical that significant genetic gains can be achieved for gray mold resistance across the complete shelf life spectrum in strawberry but are confident that postharvest gray mold incidence can be minimized but obviously not eliminated in LSL populations. This conclusion seems well aligned with previous findings in strawberry and other hosts of this pathogen (Finkers et al. 2007a, 2007b; Rowe and Kliebenstein 2008; Lewers et al. 2012). Because several fruit quality traits pleiotropically affect gray mold resistance in strawberry, the challenge is exponentially greater when breeding for markets where softer fruits with elevated sugars are preferred and LSL phenotypes are neither necessary nor preferred (Figures 1, 2 and 6). However, for markets where LSL cultivars are essential, direct selection for the requisite fruit quality traits seems to confer sufficient resistance to gray mold to ensure marketability under normal postharvest storage conditions and timelines, especially for fruit produced in coastal California and other arid and semi-arid environments with low humidity and rainfall (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S1). Although we only sampled 12 coastal California environments (six locations × two harvests/location) to estimate the natural incidence of B. cinerea among eight LSL cultivars, we suspect that deeper sampling will confirm our findings., There are open questions to be addressed and were limitations to our study. First, we did not screen diverse germplasm to identify sources of resistance to gray mold. As our study and others have shown, strong sources of resistance to this pathogen may not exist (Chandler et al. 2006; Seijo et al. 2008; Lewers et al. 2012; Bestfleisch et al. 2015). The narrow-sense heritability estimates and genomic prediction results for LD and EM in the present study suggest that a deeper exploration of genetic diversity, while challenging, seems worthwhile (Table 1; Supplementary Figure S3). The association between resistance and titratable acidity seems to be particularly promising and worthy of further study (Figure 6), particularly if increased acidity is offset by increased sugars to achieve a palatable sugar: acid balance., Second, the parents for this study were selected to assess the effects of fruit quality and shelf life-associated traits on gray mold disease development (Figure 2), not for known intrinsic differences in gray mold resistance that are genetically uncorrelated with fruit quality and shelf life phenotypes. The pleiotropic effects of shelf life-associated fruit quality traits on gray mold susceptibility appear to be inescapable (Figure 6). Our results suggest that resistance can be increased by selecting for increased titratable acidity and firmness and decreased sugars but these phenotypes profoundly affect flavor and cannot be manipulated in a vacuum (Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Diamanti et al. 2012; Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012; Verma et al. 2017). Without more extensive germplasm screening, the data needed to guide the selection of parents for future genetic studies are lacking., Third, the natural incidence of gray mold was only explored in the present study for LSL cultivars commercially grown in California (Figure 1). Highly perishable short- and medium-shelf life cultivars, as typified by the heirloom cultivars (parents) we screened (Figure 2), are challenging to grow and phenotype in such studies because they typically have low yields, are easily bruised and wounded, and cannot be harvested and handled with the same robustness as commercially important LSL cultivars. Nevertheless, a study of the natural incidence of gray mold among individuals spanning the shelf life spectrum could shed further light on genetic correlations between fruit quality and gray mold resistance phenotypes and possibly identify sources of favorable alleles underlying intrinsic resistance that are uncorrelated with fruit quality traits, e.g., biochemical phenotypes triggered by defense mechanisms (Diaz et al. 2002; Glazebrook 2005; van Kan 2006; Williamson et al. 2007; Veloso and van Kan 2018; Lorang 2019; Petrasch et al. 2019a). Because gray mold disease symptoms from artificial inoculation protocols are typically harsher than those observed from natural infections of nonwounded fruit (Figures 1 and 3), a deeper exploration of the natural incidence of gray mold seems warranted in strawberry, perhaps by simulating rainfall in field experiments through overhead irrigation or other practices to increase the uniformity and incidence of natural infection., Our results suggest that phenotypic or GS could be effective for gray mold resistance but only in certain populations and only when selection for genetically correlated traits does not antagonistically reduce genetic gains for gray mold resistance phenotypes (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3). Genetic gains for gray mold resistance are affected by shelf life-related traits through additive genetic correlations and could be reversed by simultaneous selection for fruit quality and shelf life traits that antagonistically pleiotropically affect gray mold resistance phenotypes (Figure 6). Genetic variation for fruit quality traits strongly affected the phenotypic differences we observed for LD and EM. Most importantly, the fruit quality traits associated with enhanced flavor were antagonistically genetically correlated with gray mold resistance phenotypes (Figure 6)., Cross-validation of genomic predictions in the present study shed light on the complexity of genetic mechanisms underlying gray mold resistance phentoypes and highlighted the challenges inherent in breeding for increased resistance to gray mold in strawberry (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3). The three WGR methods we applied to the prediction problem strongly shrunk breeding values to the population mean for LD in the multifamily and EM in the Royal Royce × Tangi populations. Such shrinkage is typical for moderately heritable complex diseases in plants (Rutkoski et al. 2011, 2014; Poland and Rutkoski 2016)., The prospects for identifying superior genotypes through GS were greater for LD in the Royal Royce × Tangi population and EM in the multifamily population than vice versa. Whether applying phenotypic or GS, the probability of selecting superior genotypes can be exceedingly low when breeding for resistance to genetically complex diseases in plants (Poland and Rutkoski 2016; Crossa et al. 2017; Voss-Fels et al. 2019). Nevertheless, with cost-effective genome-wide genotyping, GS has the potential to increase genetic gains by increasing the number of selection candidates that can be screened per unit of time and space (Poland and Rutkoski 2016; Crossa et al. 2017). Even in the small populations we studied (n = 380 and n = 233), nearly 20,000 phenotypic observations were collected to quantitatively assess resistance to gray mold, which included image analyses at each postinoculation time point (Figure 4). The phenotyping throughput needed to effectively evaluate postharvest traits in strawberry can be limiting, particularly when multiple harvests are factored into the equation, e.g., day-neutral cultivars are typically harvested twice weekly over a period of six to eight months in coastal California. Because the progression of disease symptoms was continuous and genotype × storage time interactions were negligible (Figure 4), phenotyping throughput can be increased by employing a response surface experiment design, e.g., by phenotyping fruit at three equally spaced time points spanning the range needed to estimate response curves and accurately predict LD and EM phenotypes (Hill and Hunter 1966; Khuri and Mukhopadhyay 2010). This is precisely the sort of breeding problem where genomic prediction methods have the greatest potential utility and applicability (Heffner et al. 2010; Jannink et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2014), despite the complexity of the underlying genetic mechanisms and variable prediction accuracies across populations, which nevertheless affect phenotypic and GS equally (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3)., Genotypic, phenotypic, and other supplemental data files, figures, and tables are centrally available at https://figshare.com.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms (i.e., machine learning or deep learning) to choose optimal genome-wide models without prior consumptions to determine genomic prediction accuracies for quantitative complex traits, especially for disease resistance (tolerance or resilience). Examples using simulated and real animal and plant data showed that the prediction accuracies (r) using machine learning were 10% greater than linear (i.e., GBLUP) and 1.3% greater than nonlinear methods (i.e., BayesR), for instance, r = 0.732–0.758 for binary and continuous traits using GBLUP vs 0.801–0.832 (Yin et al. 2020). Likewise, machine learning (i.e., linear bagging) increased 20–70% the prediction accuracy for disease resistance to photobacterium in gilthead sea bream (Bargelloni et al. 2021). To date, however, no (or very limited) studies have used both machine and deep learning methods to estimate genomic breeding values for aquaculture species., Almost all studies in aquatic animal species have employed GBLUP, ssGBLUP, or Bayesian methods to examine genomic prediction accuracies for two main groups of traits, i.e., body weight and disease resistance. A synthesis of the published information shows that the genomic prediction accuracy ranged from 0.38 to 0.89 for growth-related traits (Houston et al. 2020). On the other hand, the predictions of genomic breeding values for disease resistance varied with studies, pathogens, populations, and methods used, with the estimates ranging from 0.2 (Silva et al. 2019) to 0.8 or greater (Barría et al. 2018). For both growth and disease traits, the majority of the studies demonstrated that either linear (GBLUP, ssGBLUP) or nonlinear Bayesian methods increased the prediction accuracies of animal breeding values relative to Pedigreed-based BLUP (PBLUP) by 22–24% (Houston et al. 2020). In addition to growth and disease traits, three recent studies performed genomic predictions for meat quality in banana shrimp (Nguyen et al. 2020) or Portuguese Oyster (Crassostrea angulata) (Vu et al. 2021) as well as behavior traits (i.e., cannibalism) in Asian seabass (Nguyen and Khang 2021)., Despite the economic importance of the striped catfish in aquaculture, e.g., valuing 2.36 billion USD that accounts for 1% GDP of Vietnam, there has been a paucity of knowledge in using genomic information in breeding programs for high growth (Vu et al. 2019b) or increased disease resistance, especially Bacillary Necrosis of Pangasius (Vu et al. 2019a). The Bacillary Necrosis of Pangasius (BNP) due to Edwardsiella ictaluri has been the main contributor to 56–92% mortality during larval and fingerling rearing in this species (Vũ et al. 2017). Our earlier studies showed that there is a heritable genetic component for E. ictaluri resistance, but the heritability for this trait was low, around 0.10 across statistical methods used (Vu et al. 2019a; Dinh Pham et al. 2021; Pham et al. 2021a, 2021b). While these results suggest there are prospects for genetic improvement of resistance to E. ictaluri using conventional selective breeding, the pathogen test has posed substantial challenges in terms of biosecurity issues, times, costs, and environmental impacts (Nguyen 2014; Dinh Pham et al. 2021). Due to these limitations, genomic selection has emerged as an alternative option to increase the resistance of striped catfish to E. ictaluri, one of the most severe diseases that has caused significant economic loss for the sector world-wide., Therefore, the principal aim of this study was to assess genomic prediction accuracies of machine and deep learning methods for two main disease resistance traits (i.e., survival status and survival time) and to make comparisons with four common methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, ssGBLUP, and BayesR). In addition, we explored if imputation of missing genotypes, multiple traits analyses and significant genome-wide markers could improve the prediction accuracies for the disease-resistant traits. Our results open new opportunities for genome-based selection to increase the animal resistance to E. ictaluri in striped catfish as well as other aquaculture species infected by this highly infectious pathogen., All the methods and experimental protocols of this study were performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations approved by the animal ethics committee of the University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia (approval number ANE1826)., The animal samples used in this study originated from a selective breeding program for improved disease resistance of striped catfish to E. ictaluri (Vu et al. 2019a). In 2020, the first generation was produced based on a nested mating design with a ratio of one male to two females. A total of 166 families (32 full- and 134 half-sib families) were successfully produced following the breeding protocol as detailed in Van Sang et al. (2012) and Vu et al. (2019b). Fry of each family was kept in separate fiber glass tanks up to 3 weeks before they were transferred to stock in net hapa installed in earthen pond. When the fingerlings reached an average body weight of 15–20 g, a random sample of 100 fish per family was individually identified using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag. After tagging, a half of each family was sent to ponds for performance testing and another half was used in pathogen challenge tests for E. ictaluri resistance., The challenge test involved a total of 5328 individuals from 166 families (averaging 32 individuals per family). The experimental fish were initially acclimatized in cement tanks for about 2 weeks. Then the same number of fish from each family was randomly allocated to six cement tanks (10 m3) for the challenge test using cohabitant method (Vu et al. 2019a). The cohabitant fish (16.7 ± 6.1 g) were firstly inoculated with the bacteria E. ictaluri pathogen (106 CFU/0.2 ml per fish). Two days after the injection, they were released into the cement tanks to rear with the experimental fish with a ratio of 1–3 (or roughly 30% cohabitant fish in each tank). The bacteria were added to the experimental tanks at day 4 at a dose of 105 CFU/ml to retain the bacterial density for disease infection. The experiment was conducted over a period of 23 days when no death fish was recorded. During this period, the feeding rate was reduced to 1.5% of the total biomass in tank. Mortality was highest in day 5 and dead fish were sampled for laboratory PCR test to verify that their death symptoms (white spots in spleen, liver, and kidney) were due to E. ictaluri pathogen. At the conclusion of the experiment, all alive fish were biosecure-buried, following the regulations of the national veterinary authority (Department of Animal Health, Vietnam)., During the challenge test, death fish were collected every 3 h and their clinical symptoms were also recorded. The data were used to calculate two measures of E. ictaluri resistance, i.e., survival status and survival time. Survival status was expressed as a binary trait in which dead fish were designated as zero (0) and alive animals at the end of the challenge test were assigned a number 1. Furthermore, survival time was defined as the continuous trait from the start of test until the animal death in day. Both survival status and survival time were analyzed using linear mixed model by ASReml 4.1 (Gilmour et al. 2014) to estimate breeding values (EBVs) for all individuals (5328) and families (166) in the pedigree, with common environmental effect—c2 (i.e., accounting for differences due to separate rearing of families until tagging) fitted in the model. The linear mixed model comprised the fixed effects of spawning batch (7 levels) and challenge tanks (2 levels) and a covariate of age from birth to tagging. Estimated heritability and common full-sib effect obtained from this dataset using the above linear mixed models were 0.09 ± 0.06 and 0.06 ± 0.03 for survival status and 0.11 ± 0.08 and 0.13 ± 0.04 for survival time. Based on the EBVs ranking, 20 highest resistance families and 20 lowest resistance families were chosen from 166 families. Only families with the number of offspring greater than 9 were selected to ensure that the EBVs were estimated with a high level of reliability. Next, we randomly collected fin tissue samples of 12–15 fish per family per disease resistance group for genome sequencing using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTseqTM)., A total of 564 DNA samples (from 564 individual fish) were sent to a commercial service provider in Canberra, Australia for genotyping by sequencing using DArTseqTM technology. The DArTseqTM was based on the genome complexity reduction method in combination with high throughput next-generation sequencing using Illumina platform. The sequencing protocol including choice of restricted enzymes and library preparation was optimized for striped catfish (Pangasianodon DarTseq 1.0) using 96 independent DNA samples of striped catfish in our earlier study (Vu et al. 2020). Briefly, the PstI-SphI method (Kilian et al. 2012) was used and the compatible adaptors were designed to include Illumina flow-cell attachment sequence, sequencing primer sequence, and capturing variant length of barcode regions (Elshire et al. 2011). Then, only mixed fragments (PstI-SphI) were amplified in 30 rounds of PCR, followed by sequencing on Illumina Hiseq2500 (77 cycles per single read). Next, sequences generated in each plate with 96-well microliter were processed by proprietary DArT analysis protocol. The genotype callings were partially described in our previous studies (Nguyen et al. 2018, 2020). The average variant call-rate was 99% and the sample calling rate was 92%. With this quality control, four out of 564 samples were discarded, and 560 samples (490 offspring and 70 parents) and 14,154 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remained for further quality control by dartR package (Gruber et al. 2018). In this data, average read depth in each locus ranged 2800–122,106 sequences, reads count from 1410 to 81,949 sequences. The quality control of the genotype data in the dartR package (Gruber et al. 2018) was filtered for loci call-rate (<0.05, 4665 SNPs removed) and individual call-rate (<0.9, 2 individuals removed), monomorphic SNPs (0 SNP removed), minor allele frequency (<0.05, 2830 SNPs removed) and significant SNPs departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (<0.05, 0 SNP removed). The retaining 6,659 SNPs were blasted to the nonredundant nucleotide striped catfish genome database GENO_Phyp_1.0, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_009078355.1 (Kim et al. 2018) which matched 6470 SNPs to the genome chromosome information using Blast2GO (Conesa et al., 2005). The genotype data of 6470 SNPs and the phenotypes of 488 individuals were used for subsequent analyses., The missing genotypes were about 10.0% in this study. They were imputed using AlphaFamImpute (Whalen et al. 2020). The imputation was based on offspring-parent (i.e., pedigree) information. Specifically, this method used parental genotypes to impute the missing values of offspring genotypes and then, the offspring genotypes were used to fulfill the missing values of their parents (Whalen et al. 2020). The pedigree used in our analysis was traced back to the base population, including four generations., Variances components of the two studied traits (survival status and survival time) were estimated using linear mixed model under the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) framework in AIREMLf90 sub-program of the BLUPF90 family package (Misztal et al. 2002). AIREMLf90 uses Average Information-Restricted Maximum Likelihood method that requires less computational resources and higher accuracy of variance estimates (Masuda et al. 2014). The models included the fixed effects of spawning batch (four levels, 1–2 weeks interval between successive spawning batches) and pathogen challenge test tanks (two levels) and the random effect of additive genetics of the individual fish in the pedigree. Age from birth to tagging (124–167 days) was also fitted as a linear covariate. The SNP heritability (h2) was calculated as a ratio of the additive genetic variance (⁠σa2⁠) to total phenotypic variance (σp2⁠), where σp2 = σa2 + σe2 (⁠σe2 = environmental variance). Based on the logarithmic likelihood ratio test (LRT), the common environmental effect (c2) was not significant (P > 0.05) and hence, this effect was omitted from the statistical models used to estimate genetic variances and prediction accuracy., Accuracies of genomic prediction for the disease resistance traits (survival status and survival time) were estimated using BLUP-family methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssBLUP), BayesR, machine learning (i.e., ML-KAML), and deep learning (i.e., DL-MLP and DL-CNN)., The main difference among BLUP-family methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP) relates to relationship matrices (A, G, or H) used to solve the mixed model Equation (1) above., PBLUP: In PBLUP (Henderson 1985), a is the additive genetic effect of each individual fish with its corresponding matrix Z following a normal distribution ∼N(0, Aσa2⁠), with A is the numerator relationship matrix calculated from the pedigree records and σa2 is the additive genetic variance., GBLUP: In GBLUP (Meuwissen et al. 2001), a is the random additive genetic effect underlying polygenic effects of SNPs with a normal distribution ∼ N(0, Gσg2⁠) where genomic relationship matrix G was generated by VanRaden method (VanRaden 2008) from 6470 SNPs and genomic variance σg2⁠. The GBLUP method assumes that each SNP has small and equal contribution to phenotypic variance of the traits studied., The three BLUP methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP) were implemented in BLUPF90 package (Misztal et al. 2002). For survival status, we used generalized (threshold) mixed model in THRGIBBF1f90 (Tsuruta and Misztal 2006) known as threshold Gibb Sampling method, whereas survival time was analyzed using linear mixed models in AIREMLf90 (Masuda et al. 2014). In the Gibbs sampling, we used 200,000 iterations with 20,000 iterations as burn-in for univariate analysis. The convergence of the parameters estimates was checked using POSTGIBBSf90 program., The analysis of BayesR (https://github.com/syntheke/BayesR) was run for 50,000 steps with 20,000 steps discarded as burn-in. We used predicted phenotypes (computed in AIREMLf90 using Equation 1), as this package does not allow fitting covariates in the model. Also, genotypes executed in BayesR were converted using PLINK software (Purcell et al. 2007) together with mapping file in the previous step (see Section 2.3)., For deep learning analysis, we used DeepGP package (https://github.com/lauzingaretti/deepGP). A detailed description of the theoretical framework is given in Zingaretti et al. (2020) and Pérez-Enciso and Zingaretti (2019). In our analyses, we used two different algorithms of deep learning: multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network., Convolutional neural network comprises of 3 types of layers: (1) convolutional layers, (2) fully connected layers, and (3) input layers. In the context of genomic prediction, first convolutional layer receives data of 6470 SNPs and write it to the first layer using kernel (i.e., a definite number of SNPs is grouped or combined). Then, the pooling step is responsible to reduce spatial size of SNPs data of the convolutional layer into the second convolutional layer. There are two types of pooling such as max pooling and average pooling corresponding to maximum values and mean values of SNPs portion covered by the kernel. The process was repeated to make update value of the last convolutional layer. At the last convolutional layer, data were flattened (i.e., convert data of pooled feature of the last convolutional layer into single column feeding to fully connected layers). The fully connected layer works similarly the MLP. The hyperparameters used in our study are size of kernel (–ks 3), learning rate (–lr 0.025 0.01), dropout in the first layer (–dr1 0 0.01), dropout in the hidden layer (–dr2 0 0.1 0.2), number of pooling size (–ps 1), number of convolutional layers (–ncov 1 3), number of strides (–ns 1), number of convolutional operations (–nfilters 8). These hyperparameters are fine-tuned under DeepGP with grid search provided in DeepGP package (Zingaretti et al. 2020). As DeepGP cannot handle missing values, we used imputed genotypes for all analyses., Single step genome-wide association analysis (ssGWAS) was accomplished in BLUPF90 suite using each subset phenotype data (i.e., see Section 2.7) for both disease resistance traits. Theoretically, there were seven steps in performing ssGWAS in BLUPF90 program (Lourenco et al. 2020). Practically, univariate model of BLUPF90 was used to estimate breeding values. The inverse of genomic relationship matrix generated with xx_ija file using “OPTION saveGInverse” and “OPTION snp_p_value” were read by postGSf90 to compute SNP effect and its P-values. SNPs panels were selected based on the P-value < 0.0001 (number of the selected SNPs sets were presented in Supplementary Table S2). These SNP panels were used to test the predictive performance of six genomic prediction methods used in our study., Multi-trait analyses are only available in BLUPF90. In this study, two studied traits were jointly analyzed using PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP models in THRGIBBS1F90 (Tsuruta and Misztal 2006). This involves using Gibbs Sampling with MCMC updates including 1,000,000 iterations with 100,000 burn-in steps., The predictive performances of all seven methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, ssGBLUP, BayesR, ML-KAML, DL-MLP, and DL-CNN) used in this study were evaluated using repeated fivefold cross validation. The procedure involved a random partitioning of the full data into 5 subsets (each subset has 97–98 individuals including representatives of all the families). The phenotypes of one subset were masked and GEBV/EBV (Genomic/Estimated Breeding Value) of this set were predicted using the information from the other four subsets. This means one phenotype was used once in the validation process of one repetition. Each analysis was repeated 5 times, giving 25 validation sets in total and the correlation coefficient was averaged over 25 values. To compute evaluation metric in each validation set, the GEBV/EBVs of the predicted phenotypes were correlated to the actual phenotype. We chose Pearson correlation coefficient (Benesty et al. 2009) as an evaluation metric to consistently compare the statistical models used. Moreover, we computed Mathew correlation coefficient, MCC (Matthews 1975) for binary trait (survival status) as MCC is giving a different look (indicate which predicted value is assigned to 0 or 1 case) for binary classification evaluation (Chicco and Jurman 2020). Specifically, we used PresenceAbsence R package (Freeman and Moisen 2008) to produce 4 × 4 confusion matrix which assigned GEBV/EBV values against the actual phenotypes for computing MCC (Supplementary Table S1 for additional information and reference). To obtain the consistency and comparable results among tested software/packages, we used the same subsets of testing/validation data (i.e., 25 subsets) in BLUPF90 family program, BayesR, ML-KAML, DL-MLP, and DL-CNN., The genomic prediction accuracy for survival status and survival time was calculated as Accuracy= ry,y^h2; where ry,y^ is the correlation between the predicted breeding values y^ and actual phenotypesy⁠. The heritability was estimated using pedigree-based analysis (PBLUP models)., The average survival rate and survival time after the pathogen challenge test were 32.2% and 6.8 days, respectively (Table 1). When exposed to the E. ictaluri pathogen, mortality occurred after 1.4 days and the highest death rate was observed after 4.1 days (Figure 1). There were significant differences (P < 0.0001, Figure 1) in both survival rate (60.0% vs 4.5%) and survival time (5.0 vs 8.7 days) between 20 highest and 20 lowest resistant families (Table 1). The variations in the disease-resistant traits among families were also significant (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The results of our main challenge test experiment are provided in Supplementary Table S2., Survival trend in day post challenge of high and low resistance groups in genotyped individuals of striped catfish., Survival trend in day post challenge of high and low resistance groups in genotyped individuals of striped catfish., Number of animals (n) and phenotypes in the disease resistant and susceptible groups used for genotyping, Number of animals (n) and phenotypes in the disease resistant and susceptible groups used for genotyping, The heritabilities estimated for survival time and survival status using traditional PBLUP (0.65 ± 0.14 and 0.71 ± 0.14) were greater than those obtained from (ss)GBLUP (0.44 ± 0.09 and 0.46 ± 0.09) but they were lower than those estimated by BayesR (0.97 ± 0.02 and 0.96 ± 0.03) (Table 2). Across statistical models (methods) used, the estimates of heritability for survival status were slightly higher than those obtained for survival time (Table 2)., Variance components and heritability for survival status and survival time using AIREMLf90 and THRGIBBS1f90 sub-program in BLUPF90 and BayesR, Note that estimate of genetic variance was not provided by ML-KAML, DL-MLP, and DL-CNN methods., Variance components and heritability for survival status and survival time using AIREMLf90 and THRGIBBS1f90 sub-program in BLUPF90 and BayesR, Note that estimate of genetic variance was not provided by ML-KAML, DL-MLP, and DL-CNN methods., Figure 2 (or Table 3) presents the accuracies of genomic breeding values for survival status and survival time using Machine learning (ML-KAML) together with four other methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, ssGBLUP, and BayesR). Note that DL-MLP and DL-CNN methods are not available for the analysis of missing genotypes. When the original genotype data (i.e., un-imputed data) were used, the prediction accuracies from ML-KAML (0.67) were slightly higher than PBLUP (0.66) and they both were higher than those calculated from GBLUP (0.55) and ssGBLUP (0.55) for survival status. ML-KAML also outperformed BLUP methods for survival time (0.69 vs 0.59–0.65) (Table 3). In addition, the difference between ML-KAML and BayesR in the prediction accuracy was small (0.67 for survival status in both methods and 0.69 vs 0.70 for survival time). For both traits, ssGBLUP was slightly better GBLUP. Interestingly, both GBLUP and ssGBLUP did not improve the prediction accuracies for both survival status and survival time as compared with conventional PBLUP method., Accuracy of prediction for survival status and survival time traits using un-imputed 6,470 genotypes.

Increasement (%) = (accuracy of imputed 6470 SNPs − accuracy of un-imputed 6470 SNPs)/accuracy of un-imputed 6470 SNPs, Imputation of missing genotypes increased the accuracies of genomic prediction for both survival status and survival time across the four methods used, namely GBLUP, ssGBLUP, BayesR, and ML-KAML (Figure 3 or Table 3). The improvements for survival status were from 12.0% (ML-KAML) to 19.2% (GBLUP). For survival time, the increase in the prediction accuracy when using the imputed genotypes was largest for GBLUP (10.0%), followed by ML-KAML (8.1%), ssGBLUP (7.1%), and BayesR (5.3%). Deep learning (DL) using multilayer perceptron (DL-MLP) and convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) had lower prediction accuracies for both traits (0.67–0.73) than ML-KAML (0.75) or BayesR (0.75–0.76) methods but they (DL-MLP and DL-CNN) had higher prediction accuracies than BLUP methods (0.55–0.66) (Table 3). There were almost identical predictive performances between ML-KAML and BayesR methods for both traits regarding minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation magnitudes of accuracy in all the 25 testing sets compared to other methods (Figure 3 or Table 3)., Accuracy of prediction for survival status and survival time traits using imputed 6,470 genotypes.

Note that PBLUP uses phenotype and pedigree information only., Our multivariate analyses used PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP, and the prediction accuracies for both survival status and survival time are shown in Table 4. There were slight decreases observed in the prediction accuracy when the three BLUP methods were used to estimate genomic breeding values (GEBV) in multivariate analyses relative to univariate model.

Increasement (%) = (accuracy of bivariate—accuracy of univariate)/accuracy of univariate., The prediction accuracies for the disease resistance traits that incorporated only significant SNPs identified from genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) are given in Tables 5 and 6. When different genotype subsets were used (as tabulated in Supplementary Table S1), the prediction accuracies were generally smaller to those of the full set of 6470 SNPs. Using smaller SNP panels selected from ssGWAS with P < 0.00001 in this study scarified the prediction accuracies by 0.3–15.6%. For survival status, the prediction accuracy was reduced from 4.3% to 6.0% for ML-KAML and BLUP methods, but greater loss was observed for deep learning methods (11.2% for DL-CNN and 15.6% for DL-MLP).

 (survival status and survival time) and in all analyses (univariate and multi-trait or full genotype vs subsets), the machine learning (i.e., ML-KAML) gave the least possible biases in the breeding values prediction, as evidenced by the low RMSE (0.36–0.37 for survival status and 3.10 for survival time) and high R2 (0.35–0.39). BayesR also displayed similar predictive reliability to ML-KAML (RMSE = 0.36–0.37 for survival status and 0.311 for survival time and R2 = 0.34–0.39). Among BLUP family methods, there were no large differences in the reliability of the genomic breeding value estimation between GBLUP and ssGBLUP (for instance with univariate model using un-imputed genotype, RMSE = 0.41 and R2 = 0.20–0.21). However, they were likely less reliable than PBLUP (RMSE = 0.39 and R2 = 0.30). The utilization of the imputed genotypes in GBLUP and ssGBLUP methods reduced the prediction errors for both survival status and survival time (RMSE = 0.39 and 3.31, and R2 = 0.29 and 0.26, respectively)., Development of disease resistance lines is essential for the aquaculture sector due to the combined effects of aquaculture intensifications and environmental changes. Our study demonstrated that genomic selection can be practiced improving resistance to E. ictaluri disease in striped catfish populations, using a range of different statistical methods especially machine and deep learning, and BayesR. However, further evaluation of these methods should be made in randomly selected samples or independent families/populations to avoid any possible biases in the genetic parameters estimates and prediction accuracies for the two traits studied. Salient findings from our study are discussed as follows., First, the genomic prediction accuracies for the disease resistance traits (survival status and survival time) were substantially improved when machine (i.e., ML-KAML) and deep learning (DL-MLP and DL-CNN) methods were used relative to BLUP-family methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP). Interestingly, PBLUP outperformed (ss)GBLUP methods in our study (Figure 2), which was rarely reported in the literature as reviewed by Houston et al. (2020). This implies that the SNP assumption of (ss)GBLUP does not reflect the true SNPs’ distribution as the AI and BayesR methods, at least in our data. In addition, our evaluation of the prediction biases or prediction errors based on RMSE and R2 statistics indicated that the AI methods may be subject to the least errors in the estimated breeding values than BLUP family methods. Hence, genomic selection using AI and BayesR methods to improve E. ictaluri disease is expected to achieve greater genetic gain than the conventional selective breeding approach using pedigree and phenotype information. The genome-based selection enables early recruitment of breeding candidates and hence, potentially reducing generation time in striped catfish as expected to reduce at least a half of generation interval in dairy cattle (Hayes et al. 2009). Our results are consistent with those reported in farmed animal (Baker et al. 2020), livestock (González-Recio and Forni 2011; Li et al. 2018), and plants (Montesinos-López et al. 2018, 2019; Zingaretti et al. 2020). Despite the superiority of the machine learning methods (i.e., ML-KAML) to PBLUP, GBLUP and ssGBLUP, they had similar predictive power to BayesR for both traits in our study. Reports in farmed animals concluded that BayesR is the best amongst Bayesian and GBLUP methods (Erbe et al. 2012) but no published information is available in aquaculture species to compare with our study. Previous studies indicated other Bayesian methods (i.e., BayesB) outperformed PBLUP and (ss)GBLUP (Sukhavachana et al. 2020; Joshi et al. 2021) while GBLUP was similar to BayesA and BayesCπ for predicting nine traits of Portuguese oyster (Vu et al. 2021). To date, studies using machine and deep learning, one in shrimp (Palaiokostas 2021) that applied extreme gradient boost method (one of the machine learning approaches) and another in seabream that used support vector machines and linear bagging classification (Bargelloni et al. 2021) and reported that these methods improved the prediction accuracy for survival traits by 1–4% and 20–70% relative to GBLUP and Bayesian methods. Recently, the evaluation of deep learning model (e.g., convolutional neural network) in Bay scallop indicated this method outperformed BayesB and random regression GBLUP methods (Zhu et al. 2021). Therefore, machine or deep learning should be used for genomic evaluation of disease resistance traits, at least in this population of striped catfish. The predictive powers of these methods using AI algorithms are expected to be greater (Montesinos-López et al. 2021) when big data (e.g., hundreds of thousands or million animals sequenced) are analyzed for this population in the future., Second, imputation of missing genotypes (using offspring and parent information available in the pedigree of striped catfish) increased the predictive ability of all the seven methods used, especially BayesR by 5.3%–approximately 19% (GBLUP and ssGBLUP) relative to when un-imputed data were used. Also note that the imputation of missing genotypes in our study differed from others that used software to compute missing genotypes without considering parental relationship or shared haplotype in full-sib families, e.g., Beagle (Browning and Browning 2009) or AlphaPeel (Whalen et al. 2018). With the use of offspring-parent information such as AlphaFamImpute (Whalen et al. 2020) or FImpute (Sargolzaei et al. 2014), the imputation likely increased accuracy of G and H matrices used in GBLUP and single-step methods (i.e., ssGBLUP) (Hickey et al. 2012). Published information across species also showed that imputation from medium to high-density SNP panels (25–78k SNPs) increased the genomic prediction accuracies for resistance to parasite (i.e., sea lice count) and body traits in Atlantic salmon (Tsai et al. 2017), or from commercial SNP arrays to whole genome sequence improved the accuracies for agronomic traits in maize (Crossa et al. 2013). However, some other studies also showed that imputed genotype did not improve prediction accuracies in livestock animal breeding (Chen et al. 2014; Van Binsbergen et al. 2015; Heidaritabar et al. 2016). Imputation has several benefits, first it can be made after sequencing with no extra cost. Second, through imputation, we can increase the number of animals genotyped and the number of breeding candidates, which in turn increase selection intensity, and this can lead to increases in genetic progress made in selected populations (Gorjanc et al. 2017). Thus, imputation of low-density sequence can support our future incorporation of genomic selection for E. ictaluri disease in this striped catfish population., Third, we found that multivariate analysis did not improve the predictive ability for the two studied traits irrespective of the statistical methods. These results are not expected, despite the high and positive genetic correlations (rg) between the two traits (rg = 0.81). A bivariate analysis of harvest body weight and fillet yield in Nile tilapia also showed no improvement in the prediction accuracies for these traits (Joshi et al. 2020). Multi-trait analyses generally improve accuracy of genetic parameter estimates and animal breeding values for traits whose genetic architectures are different (e.g., low vs high heritable) or genetically antagonistic associated (i.e., unfavorably correlated). Examples of multivariate genomic prediction models involving multi-trait in cassava and wheat plants gave better prediction accuracy over univariate models (Okeke et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2017). To utilize the benefits of multi-trait analysis, we continue collecting other traits of economic importance in striped catfish, namely disease tolerance, disease resilience as well as immunological parameters to increase overall resistant capacity of the animals in this catfish population., Fourth, we suggest using the full set of SNPs to obtain a reasonable level of prediction accuracy for genomic selection to improve disease resistance traits in striped catfish. It has been well documented that the prediction accuracy increased with number of markers and sequencing depth or genome coverage (Pook et al. 2021). Due to characteristics of RAD-sequencing methods, there are still limited number of markers in our study as compared with those reported in farmed animals or plants (Davey et al. 2010; Robledo et al. 2018). It is necessary to examine prediction ability of whole-genome data when sequencing costs are reduced to an affordable level to sequence thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of animals in a near future. However, there are studies in farmed animals reporting that whole-genome sequence data improved the predictive powers for complex traits by only 0.4–5.0% (VanRaden et al. 2017; Al Kalaldeh et al. 2019)., Finally, the utilization of highly significant SNPs from ssGWAS can give comparative prediction accuracies for the two traits studied, for both un-imputed and imputed genotype data, as compared to the full set of 6470 SNPs in our present study. However, previous reports showed that using significant SNP panels selected from ssGWAS had higher accuracy in the estimated breeding values for disease resistance traits in Litopeneaus vannamei (Luo et al. 2021) or fish species (Jeong et al. 2020). On the one hand, these SNPs can be used to develop a small SNP panel to genotype a large number of animals in both the training and validation populations. On the other hand, the costs of genotyping animals for hundreds of SNPs may not be a lot cheaper than DArT sequencing as used in this study. The use of significant SNPs can be beneficial when their biological functions (pathways) are known and included in genomic prediction models. In species where reference genome or high-quality genome assembly is available, the incorporation of SNPs with biological functions (i.e., multi-omics) improved the prediction accuracy, for instance, about 5–19% for fertility traits in dairy cattle (Abdollahi-Arpanahi et al. 2017; Nani et al. 2019), or 27.4–60.7% for traits in inbred lines of Drosophila (Ye et al. 2020). Unfortunately, a good genome assembly is currently not available for striped catfish (Kim et al. 2018), this area thus deserves future studies to enable the efficient utilization of genomic information in the genetic selection program for this economically important species in the aquaculture sector., In summary, despite the high level of consistency in the prediction accuracies across the seven methods used, the estimates of heritability and prediction accuracies obtained for survival status and survival time may be potentially biased upward (e.g., the high heritability from BayesR), likely due to the family structure of the current population that included selective genotypes (high and low resistant families). However, this problem may have been alleviated because both pedigree and genotype data were included in mixed models (i.e., BLUP family and machine learning methods) to estimate genomic breeding values as described in Gowane et al. (2019). When more genotype and phenotype data and full pedigree records are collected, further analyses should be conducted to avoid possible biases in the prediction accuracies for the disease-resistant traits in this population of striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus., The genomic prediction accuracies for disease resistance traits of striped catfish were moderate to high, suggesting possibilities for the application of genomic selection to improve resilience to E. ictaluri in this population. Machine learning methods outperformed BLUP-family in almost all our analyses. However, the prediction accuracies using machine learning methods for both survival status and survival time were almost similar to those obtained from BayesR. Therefore, either machine learning, deep learning or BayesR could be used for genomic evaluation of the disease resistance traits in this striped catfish population. Furthermore, breeding to improve resistance to E. ictaluri can use survival status or survival time as alternative selection criterion as there was no significant difference in the prediction accuracies across the seven different methods used in our study. However, when more data are accumulated in future generations, it is necessary to re-evaluate the prediction accuracies and potential biases of these methods before any practical implementation of genomic selection can be made to improve the disease resistance of this striped catfish population., All data are available via Figshare portal at https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.16713361.

Our results suggest that GS will likely be a viable option for improvement of survival in extreme low salinity., Food insecurity is a global crisis that affects more than a quarter of our population worldwide, but aquaculture provides hope for meeting increasing food demands (FAO et al. 2019). Globally, aquaculture has out-produced capture fisheries for a decade (FAO 2018b), and as of 2018, is the fastest growing sector of food production worldwide (FAO 2018a). Marine and coastal aquaculture, specifically, comprised 36% of total aquaculture production in 2016, and nearly 60% of this production came from marine bivalve aquaculture (FAO 2018a). Over the last 20 years, the Chesapeake Bay, located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, has seen substantial increases in eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) production from aquaculture (Hudson 2018; van Senten et al. 2019). As of 2019, there were an estimated 429 total leases comprising 6930 total acres for eastern oyster aquaculture in the Maryland-portion of the Bay (van Senten et al. 2019). Oyster harvest increased 115% from 2010 to 2018, and the Maryland shellfish industry was estimated to have an economic impact of over $8 million (van Senten et al. 2019). The oyster industry provides a substantial input to the economy of Maryland and also provides valuable employment opportunities in coastal areas where the industry is limited., While eastern oyster aquaculture is expanding in the Chesapeake Bay, the highly variable salinity gradient is one of the most prominent environmental factors hindering production for aquaculture operations. Harvest numbers, economic input, and employment associated with the shellfish aquaculture sector in Maryland were substantially lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the abnormally low salinity in the Bay resulting from the large inflow of freshwater from heavy rainfall (van Senten et al. 2019; NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information 2021). Oyster aquaculture in the upper Bay is periodically faced with the threat of extreme low salinity (<3) resulting from heavy rainfall associated with large storm events. Large mortality events from extreme low salinity (<5) have been observed in estuarine and coastal systems globally (reviewed in Du et al. 2021), such as in the Chesapeake Bay (Engle 1946; Andrews et al. 1959; Southworth et al. 2017), in the Gulf of Mexico (Butler 1949, 1952; Gledhill et al. 2020; Du et al. 2021), and in northern California (Cheng et al. 2015). A lower optimal salinity (∼9–16) has recently been proposed for eastern oyster populations in Louisiana estuaries where freshwater input dominates the hydrodynamics of the system (e.g., La Peyre et al. 2016; Rybovich et al. 2016; Lowe et al. 2017), which is most likely the case for many locations in the northern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. Within the Chesapeake Bay, a “low salinity” oyster line currently exists (salinity ∼6–15; Allen et al. 2021), but, growth and survival at low salinity (∼6–15) is arguably different than growth and survival at extreme low salinity (<3) (McCarty et al. 2020)., Survival under salinity stress was recently determined to be a heritable trait in the eastern oyster. Survival in high salinity (∼15–23) is a distinct trait from survival in low salinity (∼6–15) (Allen et al. 2021), and survival in both low salinity (∼6–15) and in extreme low salinity (<3) have proven to be moderately heritable (salinity ∼6–15 h2 = 0.34; salinity < 3 h2 = ∼0.4; McCarty et al. 2020). However, genomic (marker-based) analyses of low salinity tolerance in oysters have not been conducted, and knowledge of the genetic architecture of a trait is important when establishing an effective breeding program. Previous genomic investigations of aquaculture traits in the eastern oyster have been focused primarily on resistance to Perkinsus marinus, the causative agent of Dermo disease (Yu and Guo 2006). In other aquaculture species, identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) have successfully been incorporated into marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs, for example, for disease resistance in Japanese flounder (Fuji et al. 2007), Atlantic salmon (Houston et al. 2008; Moen et al. 2009, 2015), and Rainbow trout (Liu et al. 2018). However, MAS is typically ineffective for most production traits due to their highly polygenic nature, meaning the trait is controlled by many loci of small effect (Zenger et al. 2019; Houston et al. 2020). On the other hand, genomic selection (GS), or the selection of individuals based on the combined genetic effect of all relevant genome-wide polymorphisms (Meuwissen et al. 2001), may be more effective for polygenic traits and produces higher accuracies of selection and higher rates of genetic gain compared to traditional, exclusively performance and family-based, selective breeding programs (Ødegård et al. 2014; Zenger et al. 2019; Houston et al. 2020). Implementation of GS for aquaculture species was once limited to well-studied species such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout (Ødegård et al. 2014; Vallejo et al. 2017; Zenger et al. 2019), but recent advances in genomic technology and resources have increased the accessibility of GS for many aquaculture species (Houston et al. 2020). The effectiveness of MAS or GS for advancing breeding depends on the genetic architecture of a trait, which is currently unknown for extreme low salinity survival in the eastern oyster., In this study, we performed QTL mapping and combined linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses in four F2 oyster families exposed to an acute low salinity experimental challenge (<3). Tissue was collected from all individuals, both dead and alive, and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated with ddRADseq (Peterson et al. 2012) were used to investigate genomic regions associated with survival and day to death. The potential for using GS to advance breeding of low salinity survival was also investigated by calculating genomic prediction accuracies via cross-validation for several Bayesian linear regression models. This work provides initial insight into the genetic architecture underlying survival in acute low salinity (<3) for the eastern oyster and will help determine whether MAS or GS may provide a better approach for selective breeding of this trait., In 2014, 10 F1 hybrid families were generated by the Aquaculture Genetics and Breeding Technology Center (ABC) at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science from crosses between individuals from the low salinity and high salinity family breeding lines (Allen et al. 2021). In 2015, eight F2 families were made by ABC from full-sibling pair-matings within the F1 families, and all larvae and seed were reared following standard VIMS protocols (Allen et al. 2021). Seed reached ¼ to ½ inch by September and were then transferred to the Horn Point Laboratory (HPL; MD, USA). Once at Horn Point Laboratory, seed were overwintered in the HPL boat basin until March of 2016 when they were put into 3/16-inch vexar mesh bags in a rack and bag setup on the intertidal beach at the Horn Point demonstration farm. Seed were grown in a rack and bag system and checked monthly for biofouling from March to November 2016. From 2016 to 2018, oysters were moved to the HPL boat basin for overwintering from November to March, and then returned to the intertidal demonstration farm from March to November. In March 2018, oysters were transferred to SEAPA® baskets and deployed on an Australian Longline system in the intertidal zone of the demonstration farm at the Horn Point Laboratory until being brought into the laboratory in May 2018 for experimentation. Oysters were ∼3 years old and averaged 92.37 mm ± 0.44 when experimentation began on May 28, 2018., Oysters from the eight F2 families (N = 70–140 oysters per family) were randomly divided into equal-sized replicate plastic baskets depending on total number of oysters for each family. Replicate baskets were secured to the bottom of custom-made Taylor floats and submerged in 6-ft diameter tanks (∼1800 L) located indoors at the Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Maryland, USA. Oysters were exposed to acute low salinity (<3) following a very similar experimental design to McCarty et al. (2020): a 1-week acclimation period at ambient conditions followed by a 2-day salinity step-down and simultaneous temperature increase. Continuously flowing Choptank River water (salinity ∼7–11) and oxygenated, heated well water (salinity 0) were mixed by hand to maintain salinity 2.3 ± 0.13 and temperature 26.9°C ± 0.07 for 36 days, from May 28 to July 5. A salinity lower than a prior challenge was chosen in hopes of increasing mortality during the experimental timeframe, as only 23% cumulative mortality was observed previously using half-sibling families (experiment 1: April 5–May 7, McCarty et al. 2020). Salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen were recorded daily with a YSI-85 handheld multimeter (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). Feeding was supplemented daily with Shellfish Diet 1800® (Reed Mariculture, Campbell, CA, USA) at 1.5% total dry tissue biomass and with 3 L of live, cultured phytoplankton from the Horn Point Laboratory Oyster Hatchery. Individual mortality was assessed daily by checking for gaping individuals (McCarty et al. 2020), and survival and day of death were recorded for every individual. Adductor muscle was sampled and preserved in 95% ethanol when individuals died, and for all individuals remaining alive at the end of the experiment., Four families (11, 43, 22, and 65) were chosen for downstream analysis because they had the largest sample size per family and had the largest range in mortality across the 36-day challenge period (i.e., individual death occurred over many experimental days). A total of 132, 114, 111, and 106 individuals were analyzed for families 11, 43, 22, and 65, respectively. DNA was extracted from a total of 471 tissue samples, 463 samples from the challenge individuals plus the dams and sires of the four F2 families, using the E.Z.N.A Tissue Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcoss, GA, USA) following the protocol for preserved animal tissue. Following extraction, DNA concentration was quantified for each sample using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Genome-wide SNPs were generated using double digest restriction association DNA (ddRAD) sequencing techniques outlined by Peterson et al. (2012). Following digestion with EcoRI and SphI (the “flex-set”), barcoded adapters (1–48) were ligated to each individual separately in a microplate format. Barcoded samples were pooled, and size selection was performed using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) to select fragments 300–800 bp in length. Size-selected libraries were amplified using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and run for 10–12 cycles with a specific indexed primer appropriate for standard Illumina multiplexed paired-end sequencing. Three total libraries were sent to GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ, USA) for next-generation single-index sequencing on three Illumina HiSeq 2 × 150 bp sequencing lanes with 15% PhiX spike-in. For each F2 family, 5% of the individuals were duplicated to calculate genotype error rate at each locus. GeneWiz demultiplexed libraries based on Illumina indexes, and libraries were further demultiplexed into individual barcoded libraries and renamed using process_radtags from the Ddocent pipeline (Puritz et al. 2014). All reads from all individuals in the four F2 families were grouped together for downstream analysis., Reads were trimmed and aligned to the eastern oyster reference genome C_virginica-3.0 (GenBank accession GCA_002022765.4; Gómez-Chiarri et al. 2015) using the dDocent pipeline with parameters A (match score), B (mismatch score), and O (gap penalty) set to 1, 3, and 5 respectively, which have proven to be more appropriate for marine species (Puritz et al. 2014; Dimens et al. 2019). After alignment, FreeBayes (version 1.2.0-dirty, Garrison and Marth 2012) was used for SNP discovery and genotype calling, and SNPs were filtered following the dDocent step-wise filtering pipeline for missing data, genotype depth, locus quality score, minor allele frequency (MAF), and genotype call depth (Puritz et al. 2014). Individuals with more than 50% missing data were removed, and retained SNPs were present in 90% of individuals, had a minimum read depth of 20 sequences per genotype, a minimum sequence quality score of 30, and a minimum MAF of 0.05. dDocent_filters were used to further filter SNPs based on allele balance, quality/depth ratio, mapping quality ratio of reference and alternate alleles, properly paired status, strand representation, and maximum depth using suggested parameters. Polymorphisms were decomposed and indels were removed using vcfallelicprimitives. Finally, SNPs were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and SNPs falling below a P-value of 0.001 in 25% or more of the population were removed. Parents for one of the families (22) had substantial missing genotype data, so the initial individual missingness filter threshold was relaxed for this family only (individuals with <65% missingness retained). All subsequent filtering steps were identical between family 22 and the other families (e.g., SNP call rate >90%, allelic imbalance, max depth, paired status, and so on). The combined LD analysis (all families combined) was performed on the dataset with initial missingness set at <50% (see below). Genotype error rate (%) was calculated for 21 DNA samples with duplicate RAD library preps (same DNA different barcode) as the cumulative number of mismatches between duplicate genotypes at each SNP divided by the total number of genotypes tested, not including SNPs that had missing data (no genotype call) for either duplicate., Linkage maps were created for each of the four F2 families independently, and phase information was estimated in OneMap following the Outcrossing Populations tutorial (“OneMap” version 2.1.3; Margarido et al. 2007). The package “vcfR” was used to load the raw, filtered SNP file (.vcf) into R for each family before linkage map construction (“vcfR” version 1.9.0; Knaus and Grünwald 2017). For each family, redundant markers and markers with segregation distortion (α < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) were removed before map building, and only markers present in 90% of the individuals were used. Markers were assigned to linkage groups according to chromosome information from the eastern oyster genome (10 chromosomes, Gómez-Chiarri et al. 2015). We thinned each linkage group to 50–100 markers to make mapping easier (i.e., less computation) and because an excessive number of markers are not needed given the architecture of the F2 families (i.e., high linkage between markers). Markers were then ordered sequentially according to their location in the genome and phase information was generated using the “map()” function (Margarido et al. 2007). A final linkage map was created for each family with linkage groups in correct chromosome order, and the OneMap file outputs were converted to R/qtl format using the OneMap-to-Rqtl-4waycross script (https://github.com/lexymccarty/OneMap-to-Rqtl-4waycross)., QTL mapping was performed in R/qtl for each family independently (version 1.44-9; Broman et al. 2003). Individuals with identical genotypes (>90% identical markers) were identified and one individual from each pair was omitted. Markers with identical genotypes (duplicate markers) and markers with segregation distortion [Chi-Square P < 0.001] were also removed. Conditional genotype probabilities were calculated (“calc.genoprob”) for each family and a two-part single-QTL model (model=“2part”) was used for phenotype day to death for families 11, 22, and 43 since the phenotype spikes at day 50, representing individuals that survived the low salinity challenge (Broman 2003). In this scenario, we first consider the binary trait where an individual with QTL genotype g has probability πg of having the nonzero phenotype (mortality in the low salinity challenge). If the individual has the nonzero value (mortality), the value is assumed to be normally distributed with mean day to death (µg) and standard deviation (σ) (Broman 2003). Therefore, we log-transformed the day to death phenotype to follow a normal distribution. All 2-part QTL models were run with 1000 permutations to determine the 5% significance threshold at the genome-wide level. For family 65, a one-dimensional genome scan was performed with a single-QTL model (“scanone” module) for day to death since all individuals died. Significant QTL were incorporated into a model (“fitqtl” module) to investigate the effect of each QTL on the two traits of interest, survival and day to death, for each family since effect models cannot be fit for 2-part single-QTL models. Finally, “refineqtl” was used to refine the estimated location of QTLs and “fitqtl” was performed on the refined locations to investigate model improvement., LD analysis was performed on the filtered SNPs from a total of 372 individuals across the four families in TASSEL (version 5.2.57, Bradbury et al. 2007). The genotype table was filtered for sites with a minimum MAF of 0.05, maximum frequency of 1, and for sites present in at least 150 individuals (Bradbury et al. 2007). Population structure was analyzed using analysis of principle components (PCA; see Results 3.4 Figure 3). Within TASSEL, genotypes from the filtered table were converted to numbers, where the homozygous major genotype is coded as 1, homozygous minor is 0, and heterozygous is 0.5. Missing values were then imputed using Euclidean distance and the 5 nearest neighbors (Bradbury et al. 2007). Once all missing values were imputed, a PCA was conducted on the imputed genotype table (Price et al. 2006). A kinship matrix using Centered_IBS was calculated from the filtered genotype table to generate pairwise relatedness coefficients for each marker (K matrix) (Bradbury et al. 2007)., Both the PCA and K matrix were used to minimize spurious associations (Lu et al. 2010). Two total MLMs were conducted, one for each of the two traits (day to death and survival). Significant thresholds were determined for each model using the Bonferroni correction: α/N, where α is the significance level of 0.05 and N is the total number of effective tests (determined using “simple” method) to account for any LD between SNPs (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995; Gao et al. 2008, 2010). Manhattan plots were created for each trait using the “qqman” package in R (version 0.1.4; Turner 2018). All significant QTLs from the QTL mapping and combined LD analyses were located in the eastern oyster reference genome C_virginica-3.0 (GenBank accession GCA_002022765.4; Gómez-Chiarri et al. 2015). Each gene, or gene closest to each significant SNP, was investigated for annotation and function using the NCBI Genome Data Viewer, and corresponding GO terms were queried for each gene/protein sequence (Johnson and Kelly 2020). R version 3.6.1 was used for all necessary analyses (R Core Development Team 2020)., The filtered SNP file used in the combined LD analysis was used to estimate genomic prediction accuracies using Bayesian linear regressions in the statistical package BGLR (version 1.0.8; Pérez and de los Campos, 2014). The genotype file was read into R using the BEDMatrix package (version 2.0.3; Grueneberg and de los Campos 2019) and missing genotypes were imputed using knncatimpute in the “scrime” package using the 4 closest neighbors (version 1.3.5; Schwender 2012). Once imputed, genotypes were recoded into BGLR format (AA = 0, Aa = 1, aa = 2) and marker effects were estimated using Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and the BayesB prior for both traits: survival was modeled as a binary trait and day to death was modeled as a censored trait with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 36. The accuracy of marker selection was assessed by randomly splitting individuals into five testing (20%) and training (80%) sets for cross-validation, and phenotypes of the testing individuals were coded as missing in the training set. This process was repeated five times for each trait and each prior. Realized prediction accuracy was calculated as the correlation between the predicted marker values of the testing set and the actual phenotypes divided by the square root of the trait heritability when all phenotypic data is included., Five independent models were run to estimate heritability for each trait, and the average of the five estimates is reported. Number of iterations, burn in, and thinning parameters were determined by assessing the convergence and autocorrelation for all models using the “coda” package in R (version 0.19-3; Plummer et al. 2006; de Villemereuil 2012). All models were run for 2.5 million iterations with a thin of 1000 after a burnin of 500,000 for both traits. For both day to death and survival, BayesB and RKHS models were rerun with the same parameters above, but after removing all SNPs within the significant region on chromosome 1 (21,800,000–32,800,000 base pairs), leaving a total of 27,273 SNPs. Realized accuracies were estimated using the same validation scheme as above. To test the effect of SNP thinning on GS prediction accuracy, we created randomly thinned datasets consisting of 25,000, 20,000, 15,000, 10,000, 5000, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10, and 2 markers, with three random replicates of each thinned marker dataset. We estimated the realized prediction accuracy for each thinned dataset using a 20%/80% testing/training cross-validation scheme as described above using RKHS and BayesB models. Thinned datasets of 25,000, 20,000, 15,000, and 5000 were omitted for the BayesB models due to computational effort and because the accuracies did not decrease during these intervals. The genetic correlation between the two low salinity challenge traits, survival and day to death, was assessed using a bivariate animal model implemented in ASReml-R using the genotype-derived relationship matrix (Gilmour et al. 2015)., The acute low salinity challenge (2.2) induced mortality in all four F2 families over the 36-day challenge period. 92%, 82%, 90%, and 100% of oysters died from family 22, 11, 43, and 65, respectively. Most of the mortality during the experiment (310 oysters, 80%) occurred from days 9 to 21 of the challenge, with peak mortality occurring on day 11 with 53 total dead oysters (Figure 1). Peak mortality occurred on day 11 for family 22 (14 oysters, 14%) and 65 (23 oysters, 23%), on day 14 for family 11 (16 oysters, 15%), and on day 17 for family 43 (11 oysters, 14%). All families had individuals remaining alive after the challenge except for family 65., Number dead for each of the four F2 families over the 36-day acute low salinity (2.2) challenge. N = 132, 111, 114, and 106 for families 11, 22, 43, and 65, respectively., Number dead for each of the four F2 families over the 36-day acute low salinity (2.2) challenge. N = 132, 111, 114, and 106 for families 11, 22, 43, and 65, respectively., All libraries yielded high-quality read data, with >93%, >70%, and >94% of raw reads retained after demultiplexing library 1, 2, and 3, respectively, which resulted in discovery of 4,092,824 SNPs for 489 individuals from the four F2 families. The total number of SNPs was significantly reduced after filtering, and the majority of SNPs were removed when filtering for SNPs present in 90% of individuals, a minimum quality score of 30, minor allele count of 3, MAF of 0.05, and a minimum average depth of 20 reads. A total of 28,638 SNPs across 399 individuals remained after applying filters. Mean read depth per site, after accounting for the number of individuals in each group, was 73 and average missingness for each individual was 3.4%. Duplicated samples had an average genotype error rate of 1.97% across all individuals (all families) and within-family error rates ranged from 1.07% (family 22) to 2.74% (family 11)., Final linkage maps were created from 123, 100, 91, and 95 individuals using a total of 380, 288, 370, and 400 genotyped markers (after thinning to 50–100 SNPs per chromosome), for family 11, 43, 22, and 65, respectively. A significant QTL on chromosome 1 was identified by the 2-part model (day to death conditional on survival) for family 11 and 43 (Figure 2). All significant markers were located between 21,000,000 and 26,000,000 base pairs on chromosome 1 (Table 1). For Family 11, a significant QTL for the 2-part model (day to death conditional on survival; red line, Figure 2) was located in the uncharacterized LOC111116948 gene on Chr1 in the eastern oyster genome. After incorporating this QTL into a single-QTL model for day to death and after refining the position, the QTL was located in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-like gene (Table 1) and explained 10.4% of the model variation, but was not above the LOD significance threshold at the genome-wide level. When this QTL was incorporated into the single-QTL model for survival and after position refinement, the QTL was located in the uncharacterized LOC111128605 gene and explained 10.5% of the model variation, but was not above the significance threshold (Table 1). This QTL, before refining, was just below the LOD significance threshold for the probability of surviving from the 2-part model (0.5 below; black line, Figure 2)., LOD plots for QTL identified from the 2-part model, day to death conditional on survival, for family 11 (top left), 43 (bottom left), and 22 (top right).

Horizontal, dotted lines indicate the 5% significance threshold at the genome-wide level after 1000 permutations for each respective test (by color)., Significant QTL (above the LOD threshold) identified from the 2-part scans incorporated into independent models (“fitqtl”) for both day to death and survival for families 11 and 43. Significant markers were refined for position (“refineqtl”) and then incorporated into each model to get percent variance (% Var) explained and a model significance value (P-value). Family 22 and 65 are excluded because there were no peaks above the LOD threshold., Gene located closest to the significant QTL., Above LOD threshold determined by single-QTL models (“scanone”)., Significant QTL (above the LOD threshold) identified from the 2-part scans incorporated into independent models (“fitqtl”) for both day to death and survival for families 11 and 43.

Family 22 and 65 are excluded because there were no peaks above the LOD threshold., Gene located closest to the significant QTL., Above LOD threshold determined by single-QTL models (“scanone”)., For family 43, the QTL region on chromosome 1 was significant for day to death conditional on survival (red line), the probability of survival (black line), and mean day to death (gray line, Figure 2). This significant QTL was located in the nuclear receptor coactivator 2-like gene in the eastern oyster genome. After incorporation into the single-QTL model for day to death and following refinement, this QTL was above the LOD significance threshold and explained 50.55% of the single-QTL model variation (Table 1). After position refinement, the QTL was located in the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1-like gene (Table 1). When incorporated into the single-QTL model for survival and after position refinement, the QTL was still located in the nuclear receptor coactivator 2-like gene, explained 32.08% of the model variation, and was above the LOD significance threshold (Table 1). There were no QTL above the significance threshold for families 22 and 65., For the MLMs, the first 10 PCAs (explaining 59% of the variation) were incorporated to account for population structure. When looking at the scree plot of variance explained for each principal component, there was a severe drop after PCA component 3 (Figure 3, A and B). Four distinct populations clustered when plotting PCA components, which represents the four F2 families. The population structure completely disappeared when plotting components 6 and 7 (Figure 3, C and D). The scree plot suggests incorporating the first 3 components, while the clustering approach suggests incorporating the first 4. Therefore, we decided to conservatively incorporate the first 10 PCAs, accounting for ∼59% of the variation, into the GLMs to account for population structure in our samples., Scree plot showing the percent variance explained by (A) all 372 PCA components and (B) the first 40 components.

There were a total of 87 and 46 SNPs for survival and day to death, respectively, that were above the significance threshold of 1.95 × 10−6 after correcting for the number of effective tests (0.05/25,685 effective tests; Supplementary Table S1; Gao et al. 2008, 2010; Yoav and Hochberg 1995).

me 41 SNPs were significant for both day to death and survival, and an additional 5 and 46 SNPs were exclusively significant for day to death and survival, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Models for both traits revealed a significant peak on chromosome 1 from 21,800,000 to 28,600,000 base pairs, as well as a significant SNP on chromosome 7 at base pair 7,251,580 (significance threshold = −log(1.95 × 10−6), Figure 4, A and C)., Combined LD analysis of survival (A,B) and day to death (1–36 days, C,D) for the four recombinant families exposed to acute low salinity (2.2) for 36 days.

Blue horizontal lines in Manhattan plots represent significance threshold after correcting for multiple tests., Comparing between traits (survival and day to death), significant SNPs were located in a total of 16 characterized genes, seven of which were shared between the two traits (Table 2). For the survival MLM, the most significant SNP (chromosome 1, base pair 23,957,309) was not located in a gene, but the next most significant SNP was located in the ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase-like gene with an R2 value of 0.128 (Supplementary Table S1, Table 2, bold). The most significant SNP (chromosome 1, base pair 25,724,354) from the day to death MLM was also located outside of a gene, but the next most significant SNP was located in the metalloproteinase inhibitor 3-like gene and had an R2 value of 0.145 (Supplementary Table S1, Table 2, underline). Including all SNPs within the significant QTL peak on chromosome 1 and the single significant SNP on chromosome 7 accounted for 8.97 and 6.51 of the total model variation (R2) for survival and day to death, respectively (Table 2). When grouping the 16 identified genes by their predicted function, 31% (5 genes) had functions related to DNA/RNA function and repair: coiled-coil domain-containing protein 13-like, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-like, nuclear receptor coactivator 2-like, nucleolar MIF4G domain-containing protein 1-like, and rho GTPase-activating protein 190-like. Another 44% (7 genes) had functions related to ion binding and membrane transport: cadherin-23-like, gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2-like, metalloproteinase inhibitor 3-like, monocarboxylate transporter 14-like, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1-like, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1-like, and zinc transporter 2-like. The remaining 25% (4 genes) had other predicted functions, such as lipid synthesis and transport and response to oxidative stress: ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase-like, oxidation resistance protein 1-like, extended synaptotagmin-2-like, choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1-like (Table 2)., Genes with significant SNPs from the combined LD analysis for both survival and day to death in extreme low salinity.

Realized accuracies for both traits were highest for the marker models with the BayesB prior, followed by BRR and RKHS (Table 3). For both traits, removing significant SNPs on chromosome 1 resulted in only a small reduction in accuracy values for both RKHS and BayesB, and the reduction was largest for both traits using BayesB. After removing SNPs on chromosome 1, accuracies for survival decreased by 0.056 and 0.1 for RKHS and BayesB, respectively, and accuracies for day to death decreased by 0.029 and 0.12 for RKHS and BayesB, respectively (Figure 5 and Table 3)., Realized genomic prediction accuracies for survival and day to death in the extreme low salinity challenge.

Accuracies were estimated using a 20%/80% testing/training validation set for all regression models (RKHS, BRR, or BayesB) using all SNPs (All) and after removing SNPs in the significant region on chromosome 1 (No Chr1)., Accuracy/√ h2; h2 survival = 0.539; h2 day to death = 0.406., Realized prediction accuracies decreased when the number of SNP markers used was reduced (thinned) to below 250. For example, realized accuracy dropped to 0.43 and 0.39 for RKHS and BayesB, respectively, when models were run with 100 markers (Supplementary Figure S1)., Narrow-sense heritability estimates were moderate to high for both traits. The heritability estimate for day to death was 0.406 (confidence interval (CI): 0.231–0.595), which is slightly lower than the estimate for survival, 0.539 (CI: 0.326–0.750). The genetic correlation between the two low salinity challenge traits, survival and day to death, was large and significant, 0.867 ± 0.027., An experimental challenge at extreme low salinity (salinity < 3) was conducted with four F2 eastern oyster families to examine the genetic basis of extreme low salinity survival. QTL mapping and combined LD analysis using genome-wide SNPs revealed significant QTL on chromosomes 1 and 7 for both traits, survival and day to death. Genes within, or proximal to, identified QTL had functions related to DNA/RNA function and repair, ion binding and membrane transport, and in the response to stress. Genomic prediction accuracies (0.48–0.57) suggest that GS is a viable option for improving survival in acute low salinity for the eastern oyster, at least based on this dataset. However, future studies with a more appropriate experimental design are necessary. Furthermore, a larger genomic prediction accuracy of the BayesB regression model, along with the lack of substantial decrease in prediction accuracy when removing SNPs within the significant QTL region on chromosome 1, suggest that survival in extreme low salinity may be controlled by many genes of small and potentially unequal effect, as opposed to being controlled by relatively few major-effect QTL., QTL mapping and combined LD analysis revealed similar QTL on chromosome 1 related to both survival and day to death. The four significant QTL (Table 1) were located within the significant peak on chromosome 1, from 21,800,000 to 28,600,000 base pairs, detected by the combined LD analysis. For the combined LD analyses, the SNPs located within the significant QTL on chromosome 1 (87 SNPs for survival and 46 SNPs for day to death) explained a total of 8.97% and 6.51% of the total variation for survival and day to death, respectively, with the most significant SNP explaining <0.1% for both traits. For the QTL mapping, a significant QTL explaining a large portion of the total variation (32% for survival and 50% for day to death) was detected for only one of the families (43) after refinement, and the insignificant QTL (after refinement) detected in family 11 explained 10% of the total variation for both traits. The relatively small contribution of our detected (major) QTL from both analyses suggests that many other markers of relatively small effect will likely have a combined large effect on the phenotype. Thus, survival in extreme low salinity (<3) may be controlled by additional genes not identified in this analysis. Aside from one study (Sauvage et al. 2010), most QTL studies in bivalve shellfish have examined 2 or fewer families (Zhan et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2012; Zhong et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016; Fang et al. 2021)., QTLs of similar magnitude (8%–40% variance explained) identified for multiple traits in salmonids have been proposed for incorporation into MAS programs (Ayllon et al. 2015; Barson et al. 2015; Gonen et al. 2015; Boison et al. 2019), but these QTL were validated across multiple populations. In this study, the significant QTL identified on chromosome 1 was detected in only two families, which happen to be the two largest families analyzed, indicating that these families could be driving the detection of the QTL in our combined LD analyses. Thus, the QTL require further validation across other families and populations to determine if they are generally useful and associated with the trait, or if they are specific to the genetic background of the F2 families tested. Our sample size was relatively small (<400) and further analyses should be conducted on a larger sample size with individuals from many populations. A sample size larger than 1000 is recommended for higher resolution when detecting QTL (Barría et al. 2018; Houston et al. 2020), and the possibility of conducting a GWAS of this magnitude is becoming more practical as genomic tools for the eastern oyster continue to be developed (i.e., SNP array; Houston et al. 2020; Thongda et al. 2018)., QTL mapping and combined LD analyses results suggest that survival and day to death are genetically similar traits. The similarity in the three LOD score curves for the QTL mapping models (2-part: day to death conditional on survival, survival as binary, and day to death with a normal distribution) suggest that similar QTL were identified when analyzing either trait independently. Similarly, the same major QTL region on chromosome 1 was also detected in the combined LD analysis for both traits, and 85 significant SNPs were shared within the same 6.8 million base pair region (21,800,000–28,600,000 base pairs). A high genetic correlation was detected between the two traits (0.867 ± 0.027), and large genetic correlations (0.95) have previously been detected for disease-related survival traits (survival and day to death) in both salmon and trout (Palti et al. 2015; Barría et al. 2018, 2020; Bassini et al. 2019). The finding that survival and day to death are genetically similar suggests that either trait could be used in future assessment of extreme low salinity survival., Combined LD analysis provided increased resolution and statistical power because all individuals were analyzed together (larger sample size). Combined LD analysis was able to detect not only the significant region on chromosome 1, but also an additional significant region on chromosome 7. Suggestive peaks for the combined LD analysis were present just below the significance threshold on chromosomes 5,7,8, and 9, and may contribute to the overall variation in this trait (Figure 4). In contrast, the family-specific QTL analyses did not detect these additional QTL, but there does seem to be a suggestive QTL on chromosome 8 for family 22 (Figure 2). Previous studies have also observed increases in detection ability for combined LD mapping (Xiong and Jin 2000; Lu et al. 2010). In our scenario, the combined LD analysis provided the most powerful analysis but is complemented by the independent QTL mapping results., For both survival and day to death, the four major QTL and 133 significant SNPs were located within, or proximal to, a total of 16 annotated genes. These genes have functions belonging to three major categories: DNA/RNA function and repair, ion binding and membrane transport, and the response to stress. Our results build upon previous transcriptomic studies of oysters and highlight potential genes and physiological processes underlying survival in extreme low salinity (<3)., Five of the 16 QTL-associated genes were annotated with functions related to DNA/RNA function and repair. Four of these genes (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-like, nuclear receptor coactivator 2-like, nucleolar MIF4G domain-containing protein 1-like, and rho GTPase-activating protein 190-like) have functions related to RNA binding and gene transcription. Previous work examining the transcriptomic response of eastern oysters to a salinity of 8 and Olympia oysters to a salinity of 5, revealed the strongest enrichment for genes related to DNA replication and transcription (Eierman and Hare 2014; Maynard et al. 2018). The enrichment or detection of genes involved in gene transcription at low salinity might reflect the importance, and necessity, of increasing transcription of genes responsible for conformation to stressful low salinities. For example, in eastern oysters, the rho GTPase-activating protein 190-like gene was previously found to be enriched at low salinity (salinity 8) and is considered an important osmoregulatory candidate (Eierman and Hare 2014). Rho proteins are also involved in anti-apoptotic processes (reviewed in Li et al. 2015), and infection of Pacific oyster hemocytes with vectors expressing the California sea hare (Aplysia californica) rho gene reduced β-adrenoceptor-induced apoptosis (Lacoste et al. 2002). Upregulation and expression of many antiapoptotic genes and pathways is a known stress response in oysters (Zhang et al. 2016), and rho GTPase-activating protein 190-like may play an important role in preventing apoptosis to maintain internal homeostasis and cell integrity during extreme low salinity exposure., The majority of genes (7/16) proximal to or underlying QTL were related to membrane transport and ion binding. Oysters are osmoconformers that regulate the concentration of inorganic ions (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) and free amino acids within their cellular fluid to maintain osmotic balance and conform to the salinity of their surrounding environment (Pierce 1971, 1982; Shumway 1977a, 1977b). SNPs significantly associated with variation in low salinity survival were detected in cadherin-23-like and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1-like, both of which are transmembrane proteins that play a role in calcium ion binding and cation channel activity (Venkatachalam and Montell 2007; Mège and Ishiyama 2017). Induction of calcium-dependent pathways is a documented response to salinity stress in bivalves (Shumway 1977a; Eierman and Hare 2014; Zhang et al. 2016; Gong et al. 2021), thereby regulating calcium metabolism, transport, and internal fluid osmolality. In addition, expression of transient receptor proteins are known to be indicative of stress (Venkatachalam and Montell 2007), and are specifically involved in the thermal stress response in both the Pacific and Portuguese oyster (Fu et al. 2021). Zinc transporter 2-like gene has functions specifically related to zinc ion binding, and this gene was previously shown to be associated with osmoregulation in the eastern oyster (Eierman and Hare 2014). A significant SNP was also detected in the metalloproteinase inhibitor 3-like gene, which prevents the breakdown of metalloproteins. Metalloenzymes, which are superoxide dismutases with a bonded metal (Cu/Zn or Mn), are part of the defense system against oxidative stress (Rudneva 1999; Park et al. 2009). These two genes suggest that zinc ion binding plays an important role in the response to extreme low salinity, and a moderate heritability for zinc ion accumulation in Fujian oysters (Wu et al. 2019) could point to a specific mechanism responsible for the observed variation in survival., The remaining four genes identified from the genome-wide analyses had functions related to oxidative stress and protein regulation. Oxidative stress results from an excess of free radicals in an organism’s cells in response to an environmental stressor (Lushchak 2011; reviewed in Rivera-Ingraham and Lignot, 2017), and expression of antioxidative genes are commonly used to indicate oyster health and stress (Zhang et al. 2016). Therefore, the significant SNPs detected in the oxidation resistance protein 1-like gene are not surprising and suggest that extreme low salinity tolerance could be influenced by genetic variation in oxidative response pathways. In addition, maintenance of ion gradients during osmoregulation is one of the most ATP-demanding processes (Hand and Hardewig 1996; Sokolova et al. 2012). Many genes involved in protein regulation were previously found to be significantly upregulated in the Pacific oyster after challenge to a low salinity of 8 (Wang et al. 2012). The identification of SNPs associated with variation in low salinity tolerance within the ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase-like gene support the notion that glycolysis and energy metabolism are likely important in maintaining cell function during salinity stress., GS prediction accuracies for all models ranged from 0.48 to 0.57 for both traits, which are slightly lower than ranges reported for production and disease-related traits in other bivalve species. GS prediction accuracies from GBLUP models for growth-related traits ranged from 0.54 to 0.67 and from 0.678 to 0.758 for resistance to Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1-μvar) in the Pacific oyster (Gutierrez et al. 2018, 2020). Prediction accuracies reported in studies of other bivalves are relatively similar, e.g. 0.63 - 0.7 for growth related-traits in the Zhikong scallop (Wang et al., 2018) and 0.4 - 0.79 for morphometric and edibility traits in the Portuguese oyster (Vu et al. 2021). To our knowledge, there are no reported genomic prediction accuracies for environmental stress-related traits in aquaculture species for comparison, but studies of survival and day to death phenotypes for disease-related traits in finfish species have reported prediction accuracies as low as 0.21 (reviewed in Houston et al. 2020). Genomic prediction accuracies are affected by the underlying trait architecture, LD structure, relatedness between training and testing sets, marker density, trait heritability, and sample size (Meuwissen et al. 2001; Habier et al. 2007; Shengqiang et al. 2009; Daetwyler et al. 2010; Neves et al. 2012; Dou et al. 2016; Palaiokostas et al. 2019). Therefore, the lower range of the prediction accuracies estimated here may be reflective of the underlying trait architecture., More likely, the slightly lower range of genomic prediction accuracies may be an artifact of the small sample size (372 individuals) used and the relatedness between training and testing sets (only 4 full-sibling families). The prediction accuracies estimated for low salinity survival in this study are most similar to those reported for growth-related traits in Yesso scallops (GBLUP, BayesB, RRBLUP: 0.3–0.6; Dou et al. 2016), where the authors assessed a population size of 349 scallops from 5 full-sibling families. Larger prediction accuracies were found for the Pacific oyster, Zhikong scallop, and Portuguese oyster where more families and larger sample sizes were utilized, e.g., greater than 500 individuals from at least 23 full or half-sibling families (Gutierrez et al. 2018, 2020; Wang et al. 2018; Vu et al. 2021). Caution should be taken when comparing our results to these larger, more comprehensive studies, as our experimental design and F2 breeding structure represent fewer families/populations than are typically analyzed in GS studies. Future experimentation with a larger sample size and more populations may increase genomic prediction accuracies, as previous studies have found training population size to have a large effect on prediction accuracies (Ehret et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2018). Nevertheless, the genomic prediction accuracies estimated here are on par with those in other marine bivalve studies, and larger than some previously reported accuracies for traits in finfish and shrimp species (reviewed in Houston et al. 2020)., Substantial thinning (reduction) in marker number (100 markers) was required to observe a noticeable reduction in prediction accuracy (0.07 and 0.18 decrease from the full marker model for RKHS and BayesB models, respectively). This result is likely a consequence of the F2 breeding design employed. However, previous studies of marine animals utilizing more families and a more appropriate breeding design (i.e., > 20 half or full-sibling families) have also reported rather subtle decreases in prediction accuracy (∼0.1) when sampling down to hundreds of markers (Gutierrez et al. 2018, 2020). Overall, these results suggest that a relatively small number of markers (100 s to a few thousand) may provide adequate genomic prediction accuracies in experimental marine populations utilizing a family-based design. However, future work with larger sample sizes and a more appropriate breeding design is needed before drawing any major conclusions., For both traits, accuracies were highest for regression models with the BayesB prior, followed by BRR and RKHS regression models. Accuracies differed by 0.064 and 0.058 between BayesB and RKHS models for survival and day to death, respectively, and we suspect that these differences arise from the weighting of the markers. For RKHS models, a traditional animal model replaced by a kernel matrix is executed, which is a matrix of genetic signal (or similarity) between individuals approximated from genetic effects (marker genotypes), as opposed to a traditional GBLUP where the genetic signal is equal to the marker genotypes (Morota and Gianola 2014; Pérez and de los Campos 2014). In RKHS models, one variance is shared and divided between all markers, so each marker is weighted the same and predicted to have the same minimal effect (Meuwissen et al. 2001). In BRR, each marker has its own variance, but all are shrunk by the same shrinking parameter (Pérez and de los Campos 2014). Finally, the BayesB prior allows for variable selection, specifically size-of-effect shrinkage, where some markers have a small effect while the rest have minimal to no effect (Meuwissen et al. 2001; Habier et al. 2011; Morota and Gianola 2014). The slight superiority in model performance by the BayesB prior could reflect the underlying nature of the trait, where survival in extreme low salinity is controlled by a few markers of small effect, such as those on chromosomes 1 and 7, plus additional markers of minimal effect. Similarly, our genomic prediction accuracies decreased only slightly (0.029–0.12) when removing the significant region on chromosome 1, further supporting the notion that survival in extreme low salinity is polygenic in nature, and that regions other than those identified on chromosome 1 contribute to the overall trait variation. It is also worth investigating additional approaches (i.e., GBLUP, BayesA, and BayesC) to ensure we have the model that best reflects the distribution of marker effects on our trait. While a Bayesian model (e.g., BayesB, BBR, BayesA, and BayesC) may fit our trait best, the animal models (GBLUP and RHKS) are easier to implement with faster run times, and differences between GBLUP and Bayesian approaches have proven to be unsubstantial (Zenger et al. 2019; Houston et al. 2020)., The narrow-sense heritability for both survival (h2 = 0.539) and day to death (h2 = 0.406) were very similar to previously reported values using a pedigree-derived relationship matrix between half-sibling families (h2 ≅ 0.4, McCarty et al. 2020). Notably, the heritability estimate for survival was ∼0.133 larger than the heritability estimate for day to death. Previous disease-resistance studies of salmon, red tilapia, and Nile tilapia all reported higher heritability estimates for threshold traits compared to their linear model counterpart (Yáñez et al. 2013; Shoemaker et al. 2017; Sukhavachana et al. 2019), which was suggested to result from a better fit of the threshold animal model for the binary trait (Barría et al. 2018). Moreover, higher narrow sense heritability values for disease-resistance traits in both Coho salmon and Nile tilapia corresponded to higher genomic prediction accuracies for these species (Barría et al. 2018, 2020), while lower heritability of disease resistance traits in the Portuguese oyster (0.1–0.11) resulted in lower prediction accuracies (0.24–0.3) (Vu et al. 2021). The correlation between high heritability values and high genomic prediction accuracies could provide an explanation for the higher genomic prediction accuracies for all survival models in this study., Overall, this initial genome-wide analysis indicates that the genetic architecture of survival in low salinity for eastern oysters may be polygenic in nature, with significant QTL located on eastern oyster chromosomes 1 and 7. Moreover, GS appears to be a viable option for improvement of this trait in eastern oysters, which is encouraging as the implementation of GS continues to become more feasible for many aquaculture species. These preliminary results require further validation using larger sample sizes and the inclusion of more families or populations to corroborate detected QTL. Future GWAS experiments will help to elucidate the genomic architecture and the genes underlying low salinity tolerance in oysters, and will ultimately provide more information about the performance of GS for improving this critical trait in oysters., All raw sequence data are deposited in NCBIs SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under project name (PRJNA756884).

Our data reveal that Pvr signaling is required for wound responses in hemocytes (cell spreading) and defines distinct downstream signaling factors that are required for either epidermal WC or hemocyte spreading., Drosophila larvae have emerged as a useful system to study tissue repair responses (Tsai et al. 2018), including wound closure (WC) (Galko and Krasnow 2004; Baek et al. 2010; Kakanj et al. 2016), epidermal cell–cell fusion (Wang et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2017), and basement membrane dynamics (Ramos-Lewis et al. 2018). Following injury, larval barrier epithelial cells at the wound edge locally detach from the apical cuticle and migrate into the wound gap. This process requires both JNK signaling (Galko and Krasnow 2004; Lesch et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2019) and Pvr signaling (Wu et al. 2009). The latter is required in some manner for epithelial extension into the wound site, though it has been difficult to identify downstream genes of this pathway given a lack of pathway reporters that function well in vivo during the larval stage., Drosophila is also a good system for studying damage-induced inflammatory responses (Brock et al. 2008; Stramer and Dionne 2014). Hemocyte responses to wounding in Drosophila are remarkably stage-specific. The recruitment of hemocytes to wounds during the nonlocomotory embryonic (Stramer et al. 2005) and pupal stages (Moreira et al. 2011) is primarily through directed cell migration of hemocytes. These migrations require hydrogen peroxide (Moreira et al. 2010) and likely other cues (Weavers et al. 2016). Larvae, which are a locomotory foraging stage that follows embryogenesis and precedes pupariation, have a different mechanism of recruiting hemocytes to damaged tissue. In larvae, circulating hemocytes patrol the open body cavity and adhere to damaged tissue if they encounter it (Babcock et al. 2008). Once at the wound, attached hemocytes spread, change from an approximately spherical to a flattened fan-like morphology, and phagocytose cell debris. At the larval stage, even hemocytes close to the wound do not respond to it through directed migration (Babcock et al. 2008). Some hints about the molecules required for blood cell attachment have been gleaned from other insect species (Levin et al. 2005; Nardi et al. 2006) and from vertebrates (Eming et al. 2007). Likewise, some studies of Drosophila cell morphology have been performed in hemocyte-like cells in vitro (Kiger et al. 2003; D’Ambrosio and Vale 2010) and even in response to wounding in vivo (Kadandale et al. 2010). However, the molecules required for wound-induced spreading in vivo and their relationship to in vitro observations remain unclear., Pvr is a Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) related to the vertebrate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (Heino et al. 2001; Cho et al. 2002). Pvr controls a variety of developmental signaling events including hemocyte differentiation (Mondal et al. 2014), migration (Cho et al. 2002; Wood et al. 2006), and survival (Munier et al. 2002; Bruckner et al. 2004; Zettervall et al. 2004). Pvr is also required for epithelial developmental migrations (McDonald et al. 2003; Ishimaru et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2007; Garlena et al. 2015) and for epidermal WC at the larval stage (Wu et al. 2009). Because Pvr is an RTK it presumably connects to a fairly canonical RTK signaling pathway downstream and some studies have identified downstream players in certain contexts (McDonald et al. 2003; Jékely et al. 2005; Fernández-Espartero et al. 2013). Notably, however, reliable reporters for monitoring pathway activity in vivo have been difficult to come by for this pathway. An alternative approach to finding pathway components, one with prior success for analyzing RTK pathways is genetic modifier screening (Smith et al. 2002; Sullivan and Rubin 2002). Here, we took advantage of the lethality of Pvr overexpression in the larval epidermis (Wu et al. 2009) to design a suppressor screen that could, in theory, identify downstream signaling components in this tissue. We then cross-checked the suppressors identified by the screen to see if they were required for larval epidermal WC or for hemocyte spreading at wound sites. This strategy revealed both shared and distinct downstream components for Pvr signaling in mediating epidermal WC and hemocyte spreading., Drosophila were reared on standard cornmeal medium under a 12-h light-dark cycle. All crosses were cultured at 25 °C unless indicated. w1118 was used as a control strain. Pvrc02859 is a hypomorphic allele (Cho et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2009). PvrMI04181 (Venken et al. 2011), referred to as Pvrnull, contains a splice acceptor and a stop cassette in an early Pvr intron which leads to truncation. Pvf1EP1624, here referred to as Pvf1null, is a null allele (Cho et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2009). Pvf2c06947, here referred to as Pvf2hypo, is a hypomorphic allele (Cho et al. 2002). Pvf3M04168, here referred to as Pvf3null, contains a splice acceptor and a stop cassette in an early Pvf3 intron which leads to truncation (Venken et al. 2011)., The GAL4/UAS system was used to drive tissue-specific gene expression of transgenes under UAS control (Brand and Perrimon 1993). For larval hemocytes, hemolectinΔ-Gal4 (hmlΔ-Gal4) was used (Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot 2004); for the embryonic and larval epidermis, e22c-Gal4 was used (Lawrence et al. 1995); for the larval epidermis, A58-Gal4 was used (Galko and Krasnow 2004). To increase Pvr expression or activation in specific tissues, various Gal4 drivers were crossed to either UAS-Pvr or UAS-λPvr (Duchek et al. 2001). For the hemocyte spreading assay, we used hmlΔ-Gal4, UAS-GFP or hmlΔ-Gal4 (Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot 2004), UAS-lifeact-GFP (Hatan et al. 2011), and UAS-CD4-TdTom (Han et al. 2011). For visualizing WC, we used e22c-Gal4, UAS-src-GFP, UAS-DsRed2-Nuc or A58-Gal4, UAS-src-GFP, and UAS-DsRed2Nuc (Lesch et al. 2010). e22c-Gal4, UAS-src-GFP, UAS-DsRed2Nuc; tubP-gal80ts was used where temporal control of the Gal4/UAS system was needed (McGuire et al. 2004)., UAS-RNAi lines employed were: From Vienna Drosophila Research Center (Dietzl et al. 2007): KK108550 (MKK3RNAi#1), GD7546 (MKK3RNAi#2), KK100471 (CG1227RNAi), GD14375 (PvrRNAi#1). Note: lines are listed as construct ID (GeneXRNAi). UAS-RNAi lines from the TRiP Bloomington collection (Ni et al. 2011) were: JF01355 (LuciferaseRNAi), JF02478 (RasRNAi#2), HMS01294 (RasRNAi#3), HMS01979 (VavRNAi), HMS00173 (ErkRNAi), HMS05002 (MKK3RNAi#3), JF02770 (PI3K92ERNAi), HMS00007 (AktRNAi), GL00156 (TorRNAi#1), HMS00904 (TorRNAi#2), JF02717 (drkRNAi), HMS01045 (maskRNAi), JF01792 (Ck1αRNAi#1), GL0021 (Ck1αRNAi#2), and GL00250 (GckIIIRNAi). UAS-RNAi lines from NIG-Fly (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/index.jsp; Accessed: 2021 November 15) were: 9375R-1 (Ras85DRNAi), 7717R-1 (MEKK1RNAi), 1587R-1 (CrkRNAi), 6313R-2 (maskRNAi#2), and 8222R-3 (PvrRNAi#2)., Other transgenic lines from Bloomington Stock Center: #9490, w*; TM6B, P{w[+mC]=tubP-GAL80}OV3, Tb1/TM3, Sb1 (Balancer Stock containing Gal80). #8529, w*; P{w[+mC]=UAS-lacZ.Exel}2 (used as UAS control). #64196, w*; P{UAS-Ras85D.V12}2 (constitutively active form of Ras85D) (Lee et al. 1996). #19989, P{y[+t7.7]=Mae-UAS.6.11}lic[GG01785]/FM7c (overexpresses MKK3) (Beinert et al. 2004). #59005, P{UAS-p38b.DN}1 (dominant negative form of p38b) (Adachi-Yamada et al. 1999). #5788, P{UAS-Ras85D.K}5-1 (wild type Ras85D) (Karim and Rubin 1998). #4845, P{UAS-Ras85D.N17}TL1 (dominant negative form of Ras85D) (Lee et al. 1996). #30139, w[1118]; P{w[+mC]=Hml-GAL4.Delta}2 (hmlΔ-Gal4). #30140, w[1118]; P{w[+mC]=Hml-GAL4.Delta}2, P{w[+mC]=UAS-2xEGFP}AH2 (hmlΔ-Gal4, UAS-GFP) (Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot 2004). #35544, y[1] w[*]; P{y[+t*] w[+mC]=UAS-Lifeact-GFP}VIE-260B (UAS-lifeact-GFP) (Hatan et al. 2011). #35837, w[1118]; PBac{y[+mDint2] w[+mC]=UAS-CD4-tdTom}VK00033 (UAS-CD4-TdTom) (Han et al. 2011)., Dissected larval epidermis (either unwounded or 4 h post pinch wounding) were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde with 2.5% DMSO in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer for 15 min. Samples were then dehydrated in graded ethanol concentrations and hexamethyldisilazane. Next, processed samples were mounted onto double-stick carbon tabs (Ted Pella. Inc., Redding, CA), which had been previously mounted onto glass microscope slides. The samples were then coated under vacuum using a Balzer MED 010 evaporator (Technotrade International, Manchester, NH) with platinum alloy for a thickness of 25 nm, then immediately flash carboncoated under vacuum. The samples were transferred to a desiccator for examination at a later date. Samples were examined/imaged in a JSM-5910 scanning electron microscope (JEOL, USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. To quantify the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, 3–5 (350×) images of each wound and 3–12 animals for each genotype were collected. These images were given to four or more persons to blindly score the hemocyte spreading phenotype. Percentages of hemocytes at the wound sites showing spreading morphology were binned into 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Scoring results of each image from different persons were averaged. Multiple images from the same animals were then averaged to obtain a “spreading index.”, The plasmid containing Pvf1d (truncated version of Pvf1 containing only the VEGF-like domain) was transformed into BL21DE3 E. coli cells for overexpression. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C to an A600 density of 0.6 and Pvf1d overexpression was achieved by induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 3 h. Cell pellets were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid, and 0.1 M dithiothreitol. Cells were lysed using a French press and the inclusion bodies containing the overexpressed Pvf1d were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Inclusion bodies were washed with the lysis buffer and stored in aliquots at −80°C. Approximately 1 g of inclusion body was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 8 M urea and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Refolding of Pvf1d was achieved by overnight dialysis against buffer containing 50 mM N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS), pH 10.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 mM cysteine. Prior to dialysis, protein concentration was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml and the dialysis step was repeated two more times. Subsequently, protein was cleared of precipitates by centrifugation and purified into a storage buffer containing 20 mM CAPS pH 10.5, 50 mM NaCl and 2.5% glycerol by size exclusion chromatography., Hemocytes were isolated from wandering third instar larvae (genotype: w; hmlΔ-Gal4, UAS-GFP +/- UAS-RNAi transgene) using a protocol modified from (Kadandale et al. 2010). Approximately 150 mg of larvae (∼100) were collected into a cell strainer (70 μm pore size) and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The rinsed larvae were crushed within the cell strainer in a 35 mm sterile cell culture dish with the cap-end of an eppendorf tube. The crushate containing hemocytes was filtered into the 35 mm dish by washing the crushed larvae twice with 500 μl of PBS. The hemocyte-containing filtrate was collected into a 1.5-ml eppendorf tube and was centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm to remove particulates. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min to collect hemocytes. The hemocyte-containing pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of room temperature Schneider’s Drosophila culture medium (GIBCO, Invitrogen). ∼1 × 105 cells suspended in the culture media described above were plated onto coverslips (Corning) that were placed in a sterile 24-well culture well (Corning). After plating, 1 μl of 44 ng/μl recombinant Pvf1 protein was added to the culture and the cells were treated for 1 h at 25°C. One microliter of 1× PBS was added to control cells instead of Pvf1 and were cultured for 1 h at 25°C. Phalloidin staining: after 1 h of Pvf1 or control treatment, the cells were washed once with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde before washing three times with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) in PBS (washing buffer) for 10 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% TX-100 prepared in 1× PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were stained overnight at 4°C with a 1:50 dilution of phalloidin-Alexa 546 (Invitrogen) made in blocking buffer followed by three washes each of 5 min. After washing, the coverslips containing phalloidin-stained cells were lifted off the well and mounted on to a glass slide (Fisher Scientific) using a drop (around 3 μl) of mounting media (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). The coverslips were sealed to the glass slide with clear nail polish and stored at 4°C until imaged. Anti-Phospho-Pvr antibody staining: Phospho-Pvr (pPvr) antibody (monoclonal antibody) that detects the phosphorylation of Pvr at Tyr 1426 (Janssens et al. 2010) was a generous gift from Dr P. Rørth (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, Singapore). Hemocytes were isolated and processed as mentioned above until the completion of blocking. Staining was performed with a 1:5 dilution of anti-pPvr (diluted in blocking buffer) at 4°C overnight. The secondary antibody was Goat anti-mouse DyLight 649 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), which was bound for 1 h at room temperature before washing and mounting onto glass slides as described above., A more streamlined version of the above spreading assay was developed for the purposes of screening. In this protocol, select UAS-RNAi lines were crossed with the screening stock (hmlΔ-Gal4, UAS-lifeact-GFP, UAS-λPvr) at 25°C. For each cross, ∼10 mid-3rd instar larvae (5 days after egg lay) carrying the Gal4 driver, UAS-lifeact-GFP, UAS-λPvr (UAS-PvrCA) and the candidate UAS-RNAi transgene were selected and placed in a glass dissection well containing PBS. Larvae were washed with 70% ethanol and PBS and then briefly kept in 300 μl of PBS. Hemocytes were released from the larvae by nicking their posterior ends with dissection scissors (Fine Science Tools, #15000-02). Collected hemocytes were transferred to an ice-cold low-retention tube (Fisher, #02-681-331). Collected hemocytes were seeded into an 8-well chamber slide (Millipore, PEZGS0816) and allowed to spread for 1 h at room temperature. After spreading, samples were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS, and mounted in Vectashield before imaging with Olympus FV1000 Confocal microscope with Fluoview software and 60× oil lens. ImageJ was used to manually measure the longest axis of individual hemocytes. Overlapping hemocytes were excluded from measurement to avoid potential interference between cells. To measure the hemocyte size before spreading, hemocytes were fixed (as above) right after isolation and washed with PBS before resuspending in Vectashield and mounting onto slides for imaging., Candidate UAS-RNAi lines were crossed with the screening stock (UAS-Pvr; A58-Gal4/TM6B, tubP-Gal80) at 22.5°C, at which the best signal to noise ratio of the screen was observed. Flies were transferred onto fresh vials every 2 days. UAS-LuciferaseRNAi and UAS-PvrRNAi#2 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Larvae, pupae, and/or adults emerging from the different crosses were observed 6–9 days after egg laying. The UAS-LuciferaseRNAi control group does not survive to the prepupal and pupal stages, whereas the UAS-PvrRNAi#2 group survives until adult stage. Candidate genes were scored as putative suppressors when their corresponding UAS-RNAi transgenes delayed the lethal stage to prepupae or pupae. Median suppression was defined by the observation of three to five pupae/prepupae in a single vial (annotated in Figure 3C with “+”). Strong suppression was defined by the observation of six or more pupae/prepupae in a single vial (annotated in Figure 3C with “++”). No suppression “–”or variable suppression across multiple trials “+/−”were annotated in Figure 3C., Pinch wounding of the larvae was carried out according to our detailed protocol (Burra et al. 2013). In cases where early expression of a UAS transgene was lethal (UAS-AktRNAi), larvae bearing tub-gal80ts, the Gal4 driver and toxic UAS transgene were raised for 6 days at 18 °C to begin development, shifted to 32 °C for 2 days to reach mid-third-instar, and then allowed to recover at 25 °C following pinch wounding. Pinch wounds were scored as “open” if the initial wound gap remained after 24 h, and as “closed” if a continuous epidermal sheet was observed at the wound site. To calculate the percentage of larvae with open wounds, three sets of N ≥ 8 per genotype were pinched and scored for open wounds under a fluorescent stereo microscope (Leica MZ16FA with Planapo 1.6× objective and appropriate filters). To further examine wound morphology, the third instar larval epidermis was dissected and processed as detailed previously (Burra et al. 2013). To highlight epidermal morphology, a mouse monoclonal antibody against Fasciclin III was used (1:50; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). An Olympus FV1000 Confocal microscope, Olympus 20× oil lens and Fluoview software were used to obtain images of the dissected epidermal whole mounts., Larval epidermal wholemounts were dissected and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 4°C overnight followed by blocking in PBS with 1% heat inactivated goat serum and 0.3% triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: Mouse anti-Fasciclin III (1:50; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) was used to label epidermal cell boundaries and Rabbit anti-activated caspase 3 (BD Biosciences, cat # 559565, 1:200) was used to detect apoptotic cells. After washing with 0.3% triton X-100 in PBS (PBST), tissues were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibodies (Invitrogen A11001, 1:500) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (life technologies, A21244, 1:500) for 3 h at room temperature before washing with PBST, mounting (VECTASHIELD, Vector laboratories, H1000-10) and imaging using an Olympus FV1000 as described above., For statistical analysis of the WC phenotype between genotypes, one-way ANOVA (Dunn’s multiple comparisons) were used to test the significance of experiments., For statistical analysis of hemocyte spreading, if the data of all the genotypes passed D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test, unpaired two-tailed t-test (two groups) or one-way ANOVA (more than two groups, Dunn’s multiple comparisons) were used to test the significance of experiments. When data from one or more genotypes did not pass D’Agostino and Pearson ominbus normality test, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (two groups) or Kruskal–Wallis test (more than two groups, Dunn’s multiple comparisons) were used to test the significance of experiments. For all quantitations: ns, not significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001., In Drosophila larvae, circulating hemocytes adhere to wound sites if they encounter the wound surface by chance (Babcock et al. 2008). Once there, they assume a spread morphology and phagocytose wound-associated debris (Babcock et al. 2008). We sought to identify factors that might be responsible for hemoctye spreading in vivo. We began our search with transmembrane proteins known to be expressed on hemocytes and known to affect hemocyte biology. Pvr (platelet-derived growth factor/VEGF-related receptor) fits these criteria (Heino et al. 2001; Cho et al. 2002; Bruckner et al. 2004). To observe hemocytes at wound sites, we pinch-wounded (Burra et al. 2013) third instar Drosophila larvae and used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the morphology of wound-adherent hemocytes (see schematic in Figure 1A). In control larvae (Figure 1B, see also Supplementary Table S1 for list of genotypes relevant to each figure panel) large numbers of hemocytes bound to the wound and assumed a spread morphology. In Pvrnull/hypo (see Materials and methods and Supplementary Table S1 for allele designations) there were much fewer hemocytes at the wound site (Figure 1C). This is to be expected, as Pvr is required for hemocyte survival in embryos (Bruckner et al. 2004). Further, Pvr activation (Zettervall et al. 2004) or Pvf2 overexpression (Munier et al. 2002) can drive hemocyte proliferation at the larval stage. We also observed greatly reduced hemocyte numbers in Pvf2hypo and in Pvf3null mutants at the wound sites (Figure 1, D and E), suggesting that these ligands may also be required for hemocyte survival. The third VEGF-like ligand, Pvf1, showed a different phenotype at wound sites (Figure 1F) compared to Pvf2 and Pvf3 mutants. While hemocytes were present in substantial numbers at wound sites within Pvf1null larvae, closer examination revealed that they possessed a morphology distinct from controls. Higher magnification views of control larvae (Figure 1G) show that spread hemocytes formed a dense and interlinked network of cell processes over the wound site. In Pvf1null mutants the hemocytes adhered, but had a distinctly rounded morphology, with few broad and flattened membrane sheets, even when in close proximity to each other (Figure 1H). Quantitation of the spreading index (see Materials and methods and Supplementary Figure S1 which illustrates the scoring metric used) between these two genotypes revealed a significant difference in visible morphology (Figure 1I). In sum, Pvr and two of its ligands, Pvf2 and Pvf3, are required for normal numbers of wound-adherent hemocytes, while Pvf1 is required for these cells to assume a spread morphology at the wound site., Pvr and Pvf1 are required for hemoctye spreading at larval wound sites.

We tested this in another way, by modifying an in vitro assay for hemocyte spreading (Figure 2A) (Kiger et al. 2003; D’Ambrosio and Vale 2010). Lineage-labeled plasmatocytes (hmlΔ-Gal4, UAS-GFP) were collected from third instar larvae, plated, and exposed to enriched (Supplementary Figure S2A) Pvf1 VEGF-like domain (see Materials and methods). This enriched protein was active, as assessed by its ability to cause Pvr phosphorylation in isolated hemocytes (Supplementary Figure S2, B and B′). The phosphorylation signal was specific, as it depended upon Pvr expression in the isolated hemocytes (Supplementary Figure S2, C and C′)., Testing the role of Pvr/Pvf1 in hemocyte spreading with in vitro assays.

(H) n = 25; ns, not significant (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test)., Control hemocytes plated in vitro assumed a rounded morphology, as assessed by the cytoplasmic GFP label (Figure 2B). When stained with phalloidin, which labels filamentous actin, these cells exhibited a peripheral ring of dense actin filaments (Figure 2B, top row). Exposure to enriched and active Pvf1 VEGF-like domain during the period of plating altered the morphology of these cells—they now exhibited a large lamellipodial-like fan extending outwards from the peripheral actin ring (Figure 2B, bottom row). To determine whether this in vitro Pvf1-dependent spreading requires the Pvr receptor, we isolated hemocytes coexpressing a UAS-PvrRNAi transgene whose efficacy has been verified in other assays (Wu et al. 2009; Lopez-Bellido et al. 2019). In the absence of exogenous Pvf1 protein, hemocytes expressing UAS-PvrRNAi#2 had a morphology and actin distribution similar to controls (Figure 2C, top row). These same cells, when plated in the presence of Pvf1 protein, exhibited an apparent increase in cellular actin staining but did not spread outwards to form a lamellipodial fan (Figure 2C, bottom row)., Finally, we determined whether hyperactivation of Pvr in vivo through expression of the constitutively active UAS-PvrCA transgene (Duchek et al. 2001) could directly lead to spreading of hemocytes. Hemocytes expressing a UAS-LifeactGFP transgene (to label filamentous actin) and a UAS-controlRNAi transgene (Figure 2D) possessed a simple rounded morphology in vitro. By contrast, hemocytes coexpressing UAS-PvrCA and UAS-LuciferaseRNAi transgene (to equalize the number of UAS transgenes in the experimental setup) exhibited prominent lamellipodial fans (Figure 2E) similar to those observed upon coculture with the Pvf1 VEGF-like domain (Figure 2B, bottom row). The spreading phenotype of different genotypes was measured based on the average of individual cell diameters measured at the longest axis for each cell. Cell diameters of hemocytes expressing UAS-PvrCA and UAS-controlRNAi were significantly larger than control (Figure 2G). The presence of UAS-PvrCA–induced lamellipodial fans was dependent upon Pvr, as coexpression of UAS-PvrCA and UAS-PvrRNAi#1 led to hemocytes with a simple rounded morphology (Figure 2, F and G). The fan-like morphology of hemocytes expressing activated Pvr was not simply due to an increase in the original size of the hemocytes. When we measured cell size before plating (Figure 2H, see representative micrographs in Supplementary Figure S3), there was no difference in the cell diameter of hemocytes expressing UAS-PvrCA vs controls. By contrast, UAS-PvrCA-expressing hemocytes were of significantly greater diameter 1 h after plating, an effect that was dependent upon expression of Pvr (Figure 2G). Together, these data demonstrate that Pvf1 causes hemocyte spreading via Pvr activation., Pvr signaling has a unique place in Drosophila tissue damage responses in that it is required in multiple tissues for diverse cellular responses. In the larval epithelium, Pvr is required for WC (Wu et al. 2009), in nociceptive sensory neurons for the perception of noxious mechanical stimuli (Lopez-Bellido et al. 2019), and in hemocytes for spreading at wound sites (Figure 1). A challenge in studying this pathway has been that there are no broadly useful reporters of downstream pathway activity. The anti-phospho-Pvr antibody used in Supplementary Figure S2 is only useful on isolated cells and not for wholemount tissue stains (data not shown). Given these challenges, we designed a genetic screen to efficiently identify genes that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
act downstream of Pvr activation. To do this, we took advantage of the fact that overexpression of Pvr in the Drosophila larval epidermis is lethal (Wu et al. 2009). The screen itself is a lethality suppressor screen (see conceptual schematic in Figure 3A). We reasoned that coexpression of UAS-RNAi transgenes targeting potential downstream genes would suppress the lethality induced by overexpression of Pvr. The screening stock(s) and crossing scheme for the screen is depicted in Figure 3B and hinges on the use of the Gal80 system (Vef et al. 2006) to suppress expression of UAS-Pvr and keep the screening stock alive. The candidate set of UAS-RNAi lines included known kinases and adaptors that act downstream of RTKs as well as a broader set of such genes (see Supplementary Table S2). The first phenotype screened was the presence of pupae in the vials coexpressing UAS-Pvr and the UAS-GeneXRNAi transgenes. In total, 530 genes were screened and 15 lethality suppressors were obtained (Figure 3C). Many of the basic components of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling, as well as a subset of common RTK adaptors and other kinases scored positive as suppressors. Ultimately, all of the lethality suppressors (and further RNAi or dominant-negative transgenes targeting them) were also screened for phenotypes in larval WC and in vitro hemocyte spreading (Figure 3C, right columns) and a subset of these phenotypes are shown in the ensuing figures., Targeted genetic screen for suppressors of Pvr-induced lethality.

N.D., not determined., In the ideal case, Pvr signaling architecture would be similar between Pvr-induced lethality and WC and most or all of the lethality suppressors would then score positive as genes required for larval WC. This was not in fact observed (see Discussion section for possible explanations). Only a specific subset of the lethality suppressors were also identified as WC genes. When UAS-LuciferaseRNAi transgenes (negative control) are expressed in the larval epidermis, pinch wounds close (Figure 4A). By contrast, when UAS-PvrRNAi transgenes are expressed (Figure 4B, positive control) pinch wounds remain open at 24 h post-wounding. The open-wound phenotypes observed upon expression of UAS-RNAi transgenes targeting Ras, a small GTPase (Figure 4C), Mask, an adaptor protein (Figure 4D), and MKK3, an MAP kinase kinase (Figure 4E) are shown in Figure 4, as is quantitation of the prevalence of these phenotypes (Figure 4F). The lethality suppressor screen, while not perfect, was nonetheless quite fruitful at expanding our collection of known WC genes beyond the JNK and actin pathways (Lesch et al. 2010; Brock et al. 2012). Other genes that scored positive in this screen (CK1α) were also found in an analysis of adherens junctions at larval wound sites (Tsai and Galko 2019)., Epidermal WC phenotypes of select suppressors of Pvr-induced lethality and genetic interactions with Pvr.

We designed an experimental strategy (coexpression of UAS-PvrRNAi and a UAS-cDNA transgene for candidate genes) that would test this possibility. Certainly, suppression of the full WC defect caused by UAS-PvrRNAi is a high bar, and might only be expected to be observed for those genes at or close to the top of the signaling pathway. Coexpression of an irrelevant gene (UAS-LacZ, negative control) was not capable of suppressing the open-wound phenotype observed upon expression of UAS-PvrRNAi (Figure 4G) indicating that titrating the Gal4/UAS system with an additional UAS sequences, by itself, was insufficient to suppress the WC phenotype. By contrast, coexpression of UAS-Pvr (positive control) suppressed the open-wound phenotype of UAS-PvrRNAi (Figure 4H) about half of the time (Figure 4K). Ras suppressed at a similar level (Figure 4, I and K) while MKK3 (Figure 4, J and K) was slightly weaker. Ck1α and Mask could not suppress (Figure 4K). Of note, none of the UAS-cDNA overexpression transgenes caused an open wound phenotype on their own (Figure 4K, right side). In sum, we have identified a number of new larval WC genes, some of which, by genetic epistasis, can be placed downstream of Pvr in this particular process., We devised a parallel strategy to determine which of the Pvr lethality suppressors act downstream of Pvr in hemocyte spreading. This analysis was somewhat simpler, as we could ask whether each lethality suppressor could also suppress the hemocyte spreading induced by hemocyte expression of UAS-PvrCA (see Figure 5A, schematic and Figure 5B, control). Coexpression of UAS-RNAi transgenes targeting either Akt (Figure 5, C and E) or Mask (Figure 5, D and F) resulted in a decrease of the expanded hemocyte cell diameter typically seen upon expression of UAS-PvrCA. By contrast, UAS-RNAi and/or UAS-DN transgenes targeting MKK3 (Figure 5G), Ck1α (Figure 5H), or Ras (Figure 5I) did not block PvrCA–induced hemocyte spreading. Importantly, expressions of either UAS-AktRNAi or UAS-MaskRNAi did not affect basal hemocyte spreading after 1 h as measured by cell diameters (Figure 5J). While some of the genes analyzed (in particular Ras, Ck1α, and MKK3) caused a general/baseline decrease in basal hemocyte spreading (Figure 5J), Pvr-induced spreading was compared to the relevant baseline for each gene (Figure 5, E–I). These results demonstrate that some Pvr downstream factors (Mask) are shared between larval epidermal WC and hemocyte spreading while others, (Akt, Ck1α, MKK3, Ras) are specific for a particular cellular response., Hemocyte spreading phenotypes of select suppressors of Pvr-induced lethality.

Kruskal–Wallis multiple comparisons test., We next analyzed, using the SEM assay introduced in Figure 1, whether genes that have phenotypes in the in vitro hemocyte spreading assay (Mask and Akt) also affected wound-induced hemocyte spreading in vivo. As observed previously, control hemocytes typically form a dense lawn on the wound surface (Figure 6A) and, when analyzed at higher magnification, exhibit fan-like lamellipodial extensions either toward each other or toward the cuticle surface (Figure 6D). In larvae expressing UAS-MaskRNAi in hemocytes, the wound-adherent cells appeared less dense (Figure 6B) and possessed a wrinkled but rounded morphology that did not include lamellipodia extending either toward each other or the cuticular surface (Figure 6E). Visualization of apoptosis in wound-adherent hemocytes using an antibody against activated Caspase-3 revealed that there was no substantial colocalization of apoptotic cells and wound-adherent hemocytes in wounded larvae expressing UAS-MaskRNAi or in Pvf1null larvae compared to UV-irradiated larvae which contained apoptotic epidermal cells as a positive control (Supplementary Figure S4). In larvae expressing UAS-AktRNAi in hemocytes (Figure 6C), there appeared to be a survival defect similar to that observed for the Pvr, Pvf2, and Pvf3 ligands (Figure 1, C–E), as very few hemocytes were observed at the wound site. Quantitation of the spreading index in control vs UAS-MaskRNAi-expressing hemocytes (Figure 6F) revealed a significant defect in spreading, indicating that for this gene, the in vitro spreading defect was an accurate predictor of a requirement for spreading in vivo., Mask is required for hemocyte spreading at wound sites.

(F) Quantitation of hemocyte spreading index at wound sites in control and UAS-MaskRNAi-expressing larvae. Unpaired t-test., In this study, we establish a new role for Pvf1/Pvr signaling in regulating wound-induced blood cell spreading at the larval stage. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Pvf1 ligand and its Pvr receptor are required for blood cell spreading. First, blood cells in Pvf1 mutants show a rounded morphology at wound sites, unlike the typical spread morphology in controls. Second, Pvf1 can directly induce blood cell spreading in vitro in a manner that depends upon function of Pvr. Finally, Pvr hyperactivation promotes hemocyte spreading in primary cultures of larval hemocytes. Together these loss- and gain-of-function experiments strongly suggest that Pvf1 and Pvr are required for blood cell spreading. In this study, we also developed a new screening platform to try to identify genes that might function downstream of Pvr in the various wound responses for which it is required. This genetic screen for suppression of Pvr-induced lethality identified a number of genes, some of which have strong phenotypes affecting WC, hemocyte spreading, or both. Below, we discuss the implications of these findings for wound-induced hemocyte responses, the diversity of Pvr signaling effects in different cell types, and the architecture of signaling downstream of Pvr in different wound-responsive cell types., Larvae possess a population of circulating hemocytes that are distributed throughout the open body cavity and patrol for tissue damage (Brock et al. 2008). Hemoctyes that happen to bump into the wound adhere and spread (Babcock et al. 2008). Our work here suggests that adhesion and spreading are separable phenomena because in Pvf1 mutants and in larvae expressing UAS-MaskRNAi in hemocytes, attachment to wound sites occurs normally though subsequent spreading at the wound surface does not. In both of these genotypes, the circulating hemocyte populations appear qualitatively normal. In the fly embryo, Pvr and several of its ligands are required for survival (Bruckner et al. 2004) and for developmentally programmed hemocyte migrations (Wood et al. 2006; Parsons and Foley 2013) but not for recruitment to wounds (Wood et al. 2006). Other signaling pathways such as TNF are required for an invasive-like transmigration near the embryo head (Ratheesh et al. 2018). The differential role of Pvr and its ligands in embryos and larvae highlight another dimension to the interesting stage-specific differences in hemocyte recruitment to damaged tissue (Brock et al. 2008; Ratheesh et al. 2015). There are other contexts besides wound-induced inflammation where hemocytes adhere to both normal and foreign cellular surfaces in Drosophila. These include sessile compartments (Bretscher et al. 2015), transformed tissue (Pastor-Pareja et al. 2008), and parasitic wasp eggs (Russo et al. 1996; Williams et al. 2005). It will be interesting to see in future studies if Pvf/Pvr signaling also plays a role in these events., In addition to its roles in various developmental processes (McDonald et al. 2003; Ishimaru et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2007; Garlena et al. 2015), Pvf/Pvr signaling is required for a diverse array of tissue damage responses including epidermal WC (Wu et al. 2009), mechanical nociception (Lopez-Bellido et al. 2019), and larval hemocyte spreading during inflammation (this study). Both in vitro using S2 cells (Friedman and Perrimon 2006) and in vivo using glial cells (Kim et al. 2014) Pvr signaling screens have been carried out in other contexts. However, it has been a challenge to identify downstream Pvr signaling components that function in WC due to the lack of a pathway reporter that functions well in vivo. To circumvent this, we designed a genetic suppressor screen that exploits the fact that overexpression of Pvr in the larval epidermis is lethal (Wu et al. 2009). The reasons for this lethality are not clear but could potentially be related to a general hyperactivation of the epidermal WC response. If this hypothesis was correct, it might be expected that most identified lethality suppressors would also be required for WC. This was not observed. While a substantial set of the lethality suppressors were not found to affect WC, three factors—Ras, Mask, and MKK3—did affect WC. This divergence between lethality suppressors and WC genes could indicate a role for Pvr in maintaining the integrity or survival of the larval epidermis. Indeed, some of the genes found here overlap with Pvr signaling components found to be important for hemocyte survival (Sopko et al. 2015)., The three suppressors of Pvr-induced lethality that were also found here to be required for WC include Ras, a small GTPase; MASK, an adaptor protein required for RTK signaling in other contexts (Smith et al. 2002); and MKK3, a Map kinase kinase (Han et al. 1998). Epistasis analysis (overexpression of putative downstream Pvr genes in a Pvr-deficient background) revealed that only those components very close to Pvr in the presumed signaling cascade (Pvr itself and the Ras GTPase) were capable of partially rescuing the WC defect resulting from loss of Pvr. This could suggest that the Pvr signaling is performing multiple functions during WC and there is a split in the cascade downstream of the receptor (between Pvr/Ras and Mask/MKK3)., Interestingly, the Pvr suppressors found to be required for hemocyte spreading only partially overlap with those found required for WC. This is perhaps not too surprising since WC is a collective cell migration orchestrated by an epithelial tissue whereas hemocyte spreading is an individual change in morphology occurring in mesodermal cells. Control of actin dynamics is likely relevant in both of these tissues as Pvr has well-established roles in directing actin polymerization when overexpressed (Rosin et al. 2004) and during border cell migration (Poukkula et al. 2011). In summary, Akt is uniquely required for spreading in vitro; MKK3, Ras and Ck1α are only required for epidermal WC; and Mask is required for both in vitro and in vivo spreading and WC. These results suggest the signaling cascade downstream of Pvr differs in the two cell types and it will be interesting, now that genes are identified, to probe how these differences interact with the cytoskeletal architecture to achieve the observed changes in cell morphology., Strains and plasmids are available upon request.

While several studies have analyzed genetic parameters of growth and wood (Borralho et al. 1997; Kube et al. 2002; Hamilton and Potts 2008; Volker et al. 2008), a few studies have used genomics to study genetic parameters and prediction accuracies in E. nitens (Klápště et al. 2017, 2018, 2020; Suontama et al. 2019)., Genomic selection (GS) has become routine in animal breeding, and it is increasingly being adopted by the tree breeding community (Beaulieu et al. 2014; Isik et al. 2016; Grattapaglia et al. 2018; Thavamanikumar et al. 2020). Due to long generational intervals in trees, GS is anticipated to have a large impact on tree breeding. In addition to aiding in quality control in breeding programs, such as correcting for pedigree and clonal errors, the main benefits of GS in tree breeding include increased accuracy of the estimated molecular breeding values (MBVs), reduction of breeding cycle through early selection and increased selection intensity which will all lead to significant improvements in genetic gain (Grattapaglia et al. 2018)., One of the methods used for the application of GS in tree breeding is the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model. In GBLUP, the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix (NRM) is replaced by the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) for estimating breeding values. MBVs estimated with the GBLUP will be more accurate as the GRM captures the realized relationships between the individuals within a family and relationships among individuals from different families leading to increased accuracy of the estimated MBVs (VanRaden 2008; Goddard and Hayes 2009; Hayes et al. 2009). In most of the GS studies in forest trees, GBLUP was mainly used to estimate additive effects (Resende et al. 2012; Müller et al. 2017; Suontama et al. 2019). However, dominance plays a significant role in the genetic control of growth traits compared to wood traits. Several studies in forest trees used GBLUP to estimate dominance effects (Zapata-Valenzuela et al. 2013; de Almeida Filho et al. 2016, 2019; Klápště et al. 2017). Muñoz et al. (2014) have reported that the inclusion of nonadditive effects in the genomic model improved the precision of genetic parameters of height in Pinus taeda. However, Lenz et al. (2020) did not find significant dominance effects using polycross and full-sib families with random markers. Dominance effects, when present, can be utilized through the cloning of target trees. Dominance can also be used for mate allocation. However, in most of the studies where significant dominance effects are observed, the inclusion of them in the prediction models did not result in the significant improvement of the prediction accuracies (Bouvet et al. 2016; Resende et al. 2017; Gamal El-Dien et al. 2018; Tan et al. 2018). Accuracies of the models with the dominance effects will only be higher than the additive models when the estimated dominance effects are high (de Almeida Filho et al. 2016). In a recent study (Thavamanikumar et al. 2020), we have identified significant dominance effects for growth traits in Eucalyptus pellita (E. pellita) using preselected markers. Higher estimates of predictive ability were observed for growth traits when dominance effects were included in the prediction model., Single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) models are increasingly being tested in forest trees (Cappa et al. 2017, 2019; Ratcliffe et al. 2017; Klápště et al. 2018; Callister et al. 2021). In ssGBLUP, the GRM of the genotyped samples is combined with the NRM of the nongenotyped samples to generate H-matrix for estimating breeding values. Thus, in ssGBLUP, information gathered from all the individuals of the entire breeding population is effectively used in the analysis (Legarra et al. 2009). In contrast, estimation of the breeding values is restricted only to the genotyped samples in GBLUP. In ssGBLUP, genomic relationships of genotyped samples are projected onto nongenotyped samples leading to higher accuracy of the breeding values estimated with ssGBLUP compared to ABLUP. Several studies have indicated higher accuracies with ssGBLUP (Aguilar et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2011; Vitezica et al. 2011; Christensen et al. 2012). In tree breeding, ssGBLUP can be used to estimate breeding values of parents in environments where they were not progeny tested. Recently, Callister et al. (2021) were able to establish the links between the two distinct breeding programs of Eucalyptus globulus (E. globulus) with the combined H-matrix. For this, they used the genotype data of a small number of parents from both the programs to develop a combined H-matrix. By using the H-matrix in ssGBLUP they were able to estimate breeding values for parents in environments where they were not progeny tested. However, the application of ssGBLUP in tree breeding needs to be approached cautiously. In animal breeding where ssGBLUP is being implemented, the pedigrees are deep and accurate pedigree records are generally maintained. In contrast, most of the tree breeding populations are shallow (Gamal El-Dien et al. 2016) and pedigree errors are common (Muñoz et al. 2014). This will limit the application of ssGBLUP in tree breeding as pedigree going back several generations with well-connected families and pedigree without errors are important for implementing ssGBLUP. Unrecognized or hidden relationships and pedigree errors among the nongenotyped individuals in ssGBLUP will lead to low accuracy of the predicted breeding values (Klápště et al. 2018)., In most of the studies using GBLUP or ssGBLUP models, a GRM based on identity-by-state (IBS) was used. Very few studies have used genomic relationship matrices based on identity-by-descent (IBD) to estimate genetic parameters. Models with an IBD matrix use marker information to track haplotype blocks within the known pedigree using linkage analysis. The accuracy of this method depends on the extent of the family structure. One of the advantages of this method is that it does not require dense markers due to the limited number of recombinations that occur between the generations (Vela-Avitúa et al. 2015). Mixed results were observed comparing the prediction accuracies with IBS and IBD relationship measures (Luan et al. 2012; Vela-Avitúa et al. 2015; Forneris et al. 2016). Vela-Avitúa et al. (2015) have observed a higher accuracy of GS with the IBS matrix compared to the models with the IBD matrix at a higher marker density. At lower marker densities, however, the accuracy of IBS-GS declined while the accuracy of IBD-GS remained stable. Luan et al. (2012) observed similar accuracies between the two models using IBS and IBD matrices. However, Forneris et al. (2016) have observed higher accuracies of breeding value predictions with the IBD matrix in ssGBLUP. In a recent study in Eucalyptus dunnii (E. dunnii), higher breeding value accuracies with lower bias were observed for growth and stem form using the ssGBLUP model with IBD compared to the IBS matrix (Jurcic et al. 2021). The authors recommend using ssGBLUP with an IBD matrix in open-pollinated forest tree evaluations., In a previous project (S. Southerton, S. Thavamanikumar, B. Thumma, unpublished), we developed marker panels for several species of Eucalyptus including E. nitens with preselected markers. Markers associated with different traits such as growth and wood traits were identified by sequencing samples from extremes of trait distribution. Candidate markers with the potential association with the traits were selected by comparing allele frequency differences that are consistent across different populations. Marker panels were developed with the selected candidate markers and genotyped with the “Targeted genotyping by sequencing (TGS)” method. Thus, the marker panels developed with the preselected markers consist of trait-relevant markers of different traits., In this study, we used preselected markers associated with various wood and growth traits to compare the predictive performance of the ABLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP models in E. nitens. We have tested the ability of the preselected markers to identify the dominance effects of growth and wood traits. We have also compared the prediction accuracies of GBLUP and ssGBLUP models using IBS and IBD relationship matrices., A third-generation breeding population consisting of 8221 trees from six progeny trials in Tasmania were used in this study (Table 1). In total, 199 families from 330 parents were used in this study. Of the 199 families, 139 were OP families and 60 were CP families. Of the 60 CP families, 33 were polycrosses generated with pollen pools (polymix). The number of trees per family ranged from 5 to 69 with an average of 41 trees., Details of the breeding population used in this study, Details of the breeding population used in this study, From the total population of 8221 trees, 868 progeny from 172 families were genotyped. In addition, 547 parents of which 255 were the parents of the families used in this study were also genotyped. In total, 1415 trees were genotyped. Trees for genotyping were selected based on the criteria that they all have three traits measured including growth and wood quality traits. Families were selected based on the criteria that they have a minimum of 8 trees per family. The number of trees genotyped per family ranged from 1 to 15 with an average of 5 trees per family., Diameter at breast height (DBH-cm) was measured across all the 8221 trees used in this study while wood density (DEN-kg/m3) and kraft pulp yield (KPY-%) were measured only in 868 genotyped trees. Wood density (DEN) was measured using a Resistograph tool (Downes et al. 2018). Wood core samples were used to estimate KPY with Near Infra-Red spectral analysis (Downes et al. 2010). DBH data from six trials and wood trait data from three trials were used in this study (Table 1)., In a previous project (S. Southerton, S. Thavamanikumar, B. Thumma, unpublished), markers with potential association with different traits of E. nitens were identified. For this, field trials consisting of several first-generation families from three contrasting sites were used as a discovery population for the identification of the markers. In total, 400 to 600 trees from each trial were used. The families used in these trials represent a cross-section of genetic material used in E. nitens breeding programs in Australia. DNA samples from trait extremes were pooled and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Candidate genes affecting growth and wood traits from earlier studies (Thumma et al. 2012; Thavamanikumar et al. 2014) were used to capture the gene regions before high throughput sequencing. The three most important traits in forest tree breeding i.e., DBH, pulp yield, wood density were used in making the DNA pools. Pools were made separately for each trait. Three biological replicates were made from each pool. Thus, 18 pools per trait were used in high throughput sequencing. Candidate markers showing the potential association with the traits were identified by comparing allele frequencies of pooled samples from trait extremes. The markers showing the highest differences between the pools were selected as the potential candidate markers. To identify the markers that are robust across different environments, markers with consistent effects i.e., marker effects in the same direction across all trials from different environments were selected. By analyzing hundreds of thousands of variants, markers showing the largest effect were selected for developing custom marker panels. The selected markers include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as small biallelic INDELs. Thus, the E. nitens marker panel consists of preselected markers associated with growth and wood traits. Marker panels for genotyping were developed with the probes to capture short genomic regions spanning the selected candidate markers. As small genomic regions were sequenced, novel markers within the sequenced regions in addition to the targeted markers will also be genotyped with this method., TGS was used to genotype the captured genomic regions at Gondwana Genomics Pty Ltd, Canberra. As specific regions were used for sequencing, high coverage (>75x) is generally obtained across the captured regions with this method. DNA from 868 progeny and 547 parents was used for genotyping with the E. nitens marker panel. After filtering for markers with <90% call rate and minor allele frequency of <0.01, 3514 markers were selected for downstream analyses. On average each marker had 3% of missing data. Missing marker genotypes were imputed based on average genotype content., We used the GRM from parental and progeny data to confirm or to identify the pedigree errors. Some of the documented relationships between the parents were corrected by the pedigree analysis with the markers. Pedigree errors among the progeny were corrected by identifying the right parents for some families. Pedigree errors were identified by comparing the genomic relationship coefficients between the members of a family and the documented parents. Individuals showing low relationship coefficients compared to the average relationship coefficients of a family and the documented parents were identified as errors. To identify the paternal parents of polycrosses, genomic relationship coefficients of a family were compared with those of the parents within the pollen mix groups used for generating polycrosses. Genomic relationship coefficients of 0.30–0.5 were used to confirm the parental and progeny relationships., Inbreeding was estimated using all the markers. Inbreeding was estimated with the “het” function of the “PLINK” 2.0 package (Purcell et al. 2007). To estimate inbreeding depression, linear and quadratic regressions were performed with the phenotype data and the estimates of inbreeding coefficients. To compare the best fit between different models, a partial F-test was performed. All these analyses were performed in R., Phenotypic data of DBH, DEN, and KPY were adjusted to account for the site and spatial effects. The phenotypic data were adjusted for structured environmental effects estimated from a model that combined design effects (augmented with row and columns within large design features) and spatial effects detected using a separable two-dimensional auto-regressive model (Dutkowski et al. 2002). To account for age differences between the trials, trait data were standardized to zero mean and unit variance. Adjusted and standardized phenotypes were used in all subsequent analyses. Four models were used to estimate the genetic parameters and breeding values. Two GBLUP models with IBS and IBD relationship matrices and two ABLUP models based on the documented pedigree, one with pedigree correction (ABLUP-PR) and another without the pedigree correction (ABLUP) were used to estimate the genetic parameters and breeding values in the genotyped trees. In addition, two single-step models (ssGBLUP-IBS and ssGBLUP-IBD) and two ABLUP models (ABLUP-PR with pedigree correction and ABLUP without the pedigree correction) with the DBH of all trees were also used., Where y is the phenotype adjusted for site and spatial effects, μ is the intercept, a is a vector of the random additive and d is a vector of random dominance genetic effects of individual trees, ϵ is the vector of random residual effects. X, Za ⁠, and Zd are the incident matrices relating to fixed and random additive and dominance effects, a is distributed as a ∼ N (0,Aσ2a) where σ2a is the additive genetic variance and A is the additive genetic relationship matrix, d is distributed as d ∼ N (0,Dσ2d) where σ2d is the dominance genetic variance and D is the average dominance genetic relationship matrix ϵ is distributed as ϵ ∼ N (0, I σ2ϵ) where I is an identity matrix and σ2ε is the residual variance. In ABLUP, A and D matrices are the average NRM and dominance relationship matrices derived from pedigree; in GBLUP, the A and D matrices are replaced by GA and GD genomic relationship matrices derived from the marker data; in ssGBLUP, the A matrix is replaced by the H-matrix., The IBD based GRM was obtained with the IBDLD v3.37 software package (Han and Abney 2011). “GIBDLD” option was used to estimate IBD GRM which uses marker information and the genetic map without the pedigree information. IBDLD estimates the IBD relationship matrix by accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers using all markers (Han and Abney 2013). To estimate the LD pattern number of consecutive loci (-ploci n) and distance (-dist k) were used jointly. For this, we have used the default values of n = 10 and k = 2 cM. The physical position of the markers was obtained by mapping the sequenced regions to the E. grandis reference genome. As we do not have the markers mapped on a genetic linkage map, we have converted the physical position into an approximate genetic position by taking 1 Mb = 1 cM., The combined H-matrix for ssGBLUP was obtained with the HIBLUP software package (Yin et al. 2019). The IBS GRM (⁠GA) based on the VanRaden method and the average additive relationship matrix from pedigree (A-matrix) were used for developing the H-matrix. For H-matrix with IBD, the GRM from IBDLD was used. A-matrix from an error-corrected pedigree was used to develop the H-matrix., For this, individuals were assigned to different groups based on available information; the group with the subscript “1” represent individuals that only had pedigree information and the group with the subscript “2” represent individuals that had only genomic information. A11 and A22 represent relationships among individuals within the group “1” and the group “2,” respectively, A12 represents relationships among individuals between the group “1” and “2”, and A21 is the transpose of A12., Where: Avg.diag is the average of diagonals and Avg.offdiag is the average of off-diagonal elements., The weighted Gw was used to develop the H-matrix, The additive relationship matrix and dominance matrix from the pedigree were developed using AGHmatrix software (Amadeu et al. 2016). Similarly, additive GRM (IBS) and dominance GRM were also developed with the AGHmatrix package. All the relationship matrices developed with different packages were used in the “SOMMER” package (Covarrubias-Pazaran 2016) to estimate genetic parameters and breeding values. Variance components were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with Direct-inversion Newton-Raphson (NR) method., Narrow-sense heritability (h2) was estimated as h2= σg 2/(σg2+ σd2+ σε2)⁠. Where σg 2is additive genetic variance; σd2 dominance variance; and, σε2 residual. Dominance to total variance ratio (d2) was estimated as d2= σd 2/(σg2+ σd2+ σε2)⁠., Where PEV is the prediction error variance from diagonal elements of the matrix from the mixed model equation (Gilmour et al. 1995), Fi is the inbreeding coefficient of the tree I, σa2 is the additive genetic variance from ABLUP and ssGBLUP models., Cross-validation tests were performed to estimate the predictive ability and prediction accuracies of breeding values estimated with different models. Ten-fold cross-validation tests were performed to estimate the predictive abilities and prediction accuracies. In 10-fold cross-validation, all samples were divided randomly into ten folds. Samples from nine folds were used to develop the prediction model (training samples) which was then used to estimate the breeding values of the left-out fold (test samples) without the phenotypes. Predictive ability was estimated as the Pearson correlation between the predicted breeding values and the adjusted phenotypes of the test samples. Similarly, predictive accuracy was estimated as the Pearson correlation between the predicted breeding values from cross-validation with the estimated breeding values (EBVs) of test samples using marker and phenotype data of all the samples. This process is repeated ten times and the average of the 10 folds is used as the predictive ability and prediction accuracy of the model. When estimating prediction accuracies of a model, the predicted breeding values from cross-validation were correlated with the breeding values estimated with the data (marker and phenotype) of all the samples using that model., Predictive ability and accuracies are estimated separately for MBVs/molecular genetic values (MGVs) from GBLUP models and EBVs/estimated genetic values (EGVs) from ABLUP models. Breeding values estimated with GBLUP-IBS are indicated as MBVs, MBVs with GBLUP-IBD are indicated as MBV_IBD, genetic values with GBLUP-AD are indicated as MGVs and genetic values estimated with the ABLUP-AD model are indicated as EGVs., Predictive ability and accuracies of MBVs/MGVs are estimated by correlating MBVs/MGVs from cross-validation tests with the MBVs/MGVs estimated with all samples, respectively. Similarly, predictive ability and accuracies of EBVs/EGVs are estimated by correlating EBVs/EGVs from cross-validation tests with the EBVs/EGVs estimated with all samples, respectively., Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the differences in predictive ability and prediction accuracy of different models. A Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed to identify the significant differences between different models. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used to test the differences between different models., GRM was used to identify pedigree errors and to reconstruct pedigree by identifying paternal parents of OP and polycross families. Sixty out of 868 trees showed pedigree errors. In total 133 individuals from 19 families were assigned paternal parents thus converting them into full-sib families. Without the pedigree reconstruction, these families would have been treated as half-sib families. Pedigree corrected progeny were used in all the downstream analyses., The estimates of genetic parameters are lower with the increased utilization of genomic information (Table 2). Genetic parameters estimated with ABLUP are higher for all traits compared to GBLUP using the 868 genotyped trees. Between the two ABLUP models, the estimates of genetic parameters are higher for ABLUP without pedigree reconstruction compared to ABLUP-PR with pedigree reconstruction. The highest difference between ABLUP and GBLUP is observed for KPY. The heritability of KPY with ABLUP is 0.93 without the pedigree reconstruction, 0.70 with pedigree reconstruction while the heritability estimated with GBLUP is 0.30., Genetic parameters using 868 genotyped trees, Genetic parameters using 868 genotyped trees, Dominance effects estimated with the GBLUP-AD model is significant for only DBH among the three traits (Table 2). For this trait, the magnitude of additive and dominance variances are equal with the GBLUP-AD model. The Akaike information criteria (AIC) of GBLUP-AD is lower than the GBLUP-A model for DBH indicating the better fit of the model with the dominance effects compared to the additive model., Among the three traits, DEN had higher dominance effects with ABLUP-PR (pedigree reconstruction). Even though high dominance was observed with ABLUP (without the pedigree reconstruction), it was associated with high standard error (Table 2). The model fit with dominance effects has not changed compared to the additive only model for the ABLUP while it has improved marginally for the ABLUP-PR model. Dominance effects with GBLUP-AD are low for DEN (Table 2)., We also estimated the genetic parameters with GBLUP using the IBD GRM. Only additive effects are estimated with the IBD matrix. For DBH, the genetic parameters estimated with IBD are similar to the IBS matrix. For DEN and KPY the additive effects and heritability estimates with IBD are slightly lower than the IBS matrix (Table 2)., Inbreeding among the genotyped samples was estimated with the PLINK package. Inbreeding depression was estimated by linear regression between the inbreeding coefficients and the phenotype data. There is a significant negative relationship between inbreeding and DBH (Table 3). Similarly, there is a significant negative relationship between inbreeding and KPY. However, there is a nonsignificant positive relationship between inbreeding and DEN. These results suggest inbreeding depression for DBH and KPY. To test the linearity between inbreeding and the phenotypes, quadratic regression was performed. The quadratic coefficient was not significant for DBH indicating the linear relationship between inbreeding and DBH. However, for KPY there is a significant quadratic coefficient indicating nonlinearity of the relationship between inbreeding and KPY (Table 3). Significant quadratic regression between inbreeding and KPY indicates epistasis as a significant factor contributing to the inbreeding depression in this trait. To compare the best fit between linear and quadratic regression models for each trait, a partial F-test was performed. The partial F-test is not significant for DBH while it is significant for KPY (Table 3). This indicates that the linear regression is the best fit for DBH while the quadratic regression is the best fit for KPY., Coefficients of linear and quadratic regression between inbreeding and phenotypes of different traits; correlation between inbreeding coefficients and dominance deviation of different traits, P < 0.0001; NS, not significant., Coefficients of linear and quadratic regression between inbreeding and phenotypes of different traits; correlation between inbreeding coefficients and dominance deviation of different traits, P < 0.0001; NS, not significant., To study the effect of inbreeding on dominance, dominance deviations from the GBLUP-AD model were correlated with the inbreeding. While DBH and KPY had a negative relationship with inbreeding, DEN had a positive relationship (Table 3). These results suggest trees with high DBH and KPY are less inbred., Predictive ability indicates the ability of a model to predict the phenotypes while prediction accuracy indicates the ability of a model to predict the breeding values. For DBH, the predictive ability with the GBLUP-AD model is the highest compared to other models (Figure 1). Among the other four models, the predictive ability is similar. For DEN and KPY, predictive ability among different models is similar. While high dominance was observed for DEN with ABLUP models, it, however, did not result in higher predictive ability compared to the additive models. The predictive ability of GBLUP models with IBD and IBS matrices are the same for DBH while they are lower for GBLUP-IBD for DEN and KPY (Figure 1). However, none of these differences were significant with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05., Predictive abilities of different models among 868 genotyped trees. ABLUP-AD for DEN is based on ABLUP-PR; ABLUP-AD for DBH, GBLUP-AD for DEN, GBLUP-AD, and ABLUP-AD for KPY are not shown as the dominance effects were close to zero for these traits., Predictive abilities of different models among 868 genotyped trees. ABLUP-AD for DEN is based on ABLUP-PR; ABLUP-AD for DBH, GBLUP-AD for DEN, GBLUP-AD, and ABLUP-AD for KPY are not shown as the dominance effects were close to zero for these traits., Significant differences between GBLUP and ABLUP models were observed for prediction accuracies (Figure 2). However, between the two GBLUP models (with IBS and IBD matrices) there are no significant differences. For all traits, accuracies with pedigree reconstruction (ABLUP-PR) have improved over the ABLUP model. The significant dominance effect observed for DEN with the ABLUP-AD (with ABLUP-PR) model (Table 2) did not result in higher accuracy (Figure 2). The high genetic effects observed with the ABLUP-AD model (Table 2) did not result in high predictive ability or accuracy indicating the inflation of genetic parameters estimated with the ABLUP model., Predictive accuracies of different models among 868 genotyped trees. Accuracies with different letters indicate significant differences with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05. ABLUP-AD for DEN is based on ABLUP-PR; ABLUP-AD for DBH, GBLUP-AD for DEN, GBLUP-AD, and ABLUP-AD for KPY are not shown as the dominance effects were close to zero for these traits., Predictive accuracies of different models among 868 genotyped trees. Accuracies with different letters indicate significant differences with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05. ABLUP-AD for DEN is based on ABLUP-PR; ABLUP-AD for DBH, GBLUP-AD for DEN, GBLUP-AD, and ABLUP-AD for KPY are not shown as the dominance effects were close to zero for these traits., Next, we tested the accuracy of predicting MBVs and MGVs with an additive model (A) and additive and dominance model (A + D). Accuracy was estimated by correlating MBVs and MGVs estimated using all samples with MBVs/MGVs from cross-validation tests using additive (A) and additive and dominance (A + D) models. While there are significant differences between the models, the difference in the accuracy between the A and A + D models for MGVs is higher than MBVs (Figure 3). This indicates that the accuracy of predicting total genotypic values (MGVs) with the additive and dominance model (A + D) will be higher than the additive model while the accuracy of predicting breeding values (MBVs) will only be slightly better with the additive (A) model compared to the additive and dominance (A + D) model., MBV and MGV accuracies with addi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accuracies with different letters indicate significant differences with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05., MBV and MGV accuracies with additive only (A) and additive and dominance (A + D) models. Accuracies with different letters indicate significant differences with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05., The pair-wise relationship coefficients of the IBS matrix had higher dispersion than those of the IBD matrix (Table 4). For unrelated individuals, the lowest pair-wise relationship coefficients were zero with IBD while they were negative with the IBS matrix. The average of the diagonals was close to one with IBD while it is higher than one with the IBS matrix. Similarly, the standard deviations of diagonals and off-diagonals were lower with IBD compared to the IBS matrix., Pair-wise relationship coefficients of IBS and IBD matrices, Avg, average of all coefficients; AvgDig, average of diagonals; AvgOffDiag, average of off-diagonals; stdDiag, standard deviation of diagonals; stdOffDiag, standard deviation of off-diagonals., Pair-wise relationship coefficients of IBS and IBD matrices, Avg, average of all coefficients; AvgDig, average of diagonals; AvgOffDiag, average of off-diagonals; stdDiag, standard deviation of diagonals; stdOffDiag, standard deviation of off-diagonals., In addition to GBLUP, we also used the ssGBLUP model to estimate genetic parameters with all 8821 genotyped and nongenotyped trees. Only DBH was used in the ssGBLUP model as data of DEN and KPY was not available for nongenotyped trees. Genetic parameters were estimated with the two relationship matrices (IBS and IBD) in ssGBLUP. In addition to ssGBLUP, a pedigree-based ABLUP model was also fitted. The ssGBLUP models had better model fit compared to ABLUP models as indicated by the lower AIC values of the ssGBLUP models. Between the two ssGBLUP models, ssGBLUP-IBS had a better model fit (Table 5). Higher heritability was observed with the ssGBLUP model using the IBS matrix compared to the other three models (Table 5). Heritability estimates of DBH with the ABLUP models using all trees (Table 5) were considerably lower than those with 868 genotyped trees (Table 2). Among the two ABLUP models, heritability estimates with the ABLUP-PR model are slightly higher than the ABLUP model., Genetic parameters estimated using 8821 genotyped and nongenotyped trees, Genetic parameters estimated using 8821 genotyped and nongenotyped trees, Cross-validation tests were performed to test the performance of ssGBLUP and ABLUP models using all 8821 trees. To reduce the influence of several nongenotyped trees and to compare the results from GBLUP analysis, tests were performed within the 868 genotyped trees. Prediction accuracies of ssGBLUP-IBD are significantly higher than the other three models (Figure 4). Prediction accuracies of ABLUP models with all 8821 trees (Figure 4) are considerably higher than those with 868 genotyped trees (Figure 2). The predictive ability of ssGBLUP models is slightly higher than the ABLUP models (Figure 4). Between the two ssGBLUP models, however, estimates of the predictive ability are similar (Figure 4)., Predictive ability (PA) and prediction accuracies (ACC) among different models using DBH data of all 8821trees. Bars with different letters indicate significant differences between the models with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05., Predictive ability (PA) and prediction accuracies (ACC) among different models using DBH data of all 8821trees. Bars with different letters indicate significant differences between the models with Tukey’s test at a significance level of α = 0.05., DBH data of all 8821 trees were used to compare the theoretical accuracies among the four models (ssGBLUP-IBS, ssGBLUP-IBD, ABLUP-PR, and ABLUP). Among all the four models, ssGBLUP-IBS had the highest accuracies among all three groups of trees (parents, genotyped, and nongenotyped—Table 6). Accuracies of ABLUP models are lower than the ssGBLUP models. Between the two ABLUP models, accuracies were higher (for genotyped and nongenotyped trees) with pedigree reconstruction (ABLUP-PR) compared to the model without pedigree reconstruction (ABLUP). Accuracy improved among all three groups (parents, genotyped, and nongenotyped trees) with the genomic models. Between the two genomic models, ssGBLUP-IBS had higher accuracies across all three groups compared to ssGBLUP-IBD. Theoretical accuracy of nongenotyped trees with ssGBLUP-IBS is the highest compared to the other three models (ssGBLUP-IBD, ABLUP-PR, and ABLUP) and among the three models, the accuracies are similar., Theoretical accuracies of different models using DBH data all 8821 trees, Theoretical accuracies of different models using DBH data all 8821 trees, In this study, we observed significant dominance effects for DBH with the GBLUP model using preselected markers. There is a concurrent improvement in the model fit with GBLUP-AD compared to the additive effects only model (Table 2). While not significant, there is a trend for higher predictive ability with the GBLUP-AD model compared to models with only the additive effects (Figure 1). In addition, the prediction accuracy of total genotypic values (MGVs) is higher with the GBLUP-AD model (Figure 3). These results are similar to those observed in E. pellita in our previous study (Thavamanikumar et al. 2020). However, the dominance effects observed in this study are in contrast to the results from other genomic studies in E. nitens (Klápště et al. 2017,2018, 2020; Suontama et al. 2019). Klápště et al. (2017) did not observe dominance effects for DBH using sib-ship reconstructed pedigree. However, they did not use the GBLUP model with the GRM which captures realized relationships among the individuals within a family and between families. In other studies of E. nitens that implemented GBLUP, dominance effects were not estimated., Preselected markers containing trait-relevant markers may have contributed to detecting dominance effects and higher accuracy of predicting phenotypes and total genotypic values of DBH in this study. In a previous study (Thavamanikumar et al. 2020), we observed significant dominance effects influencing growth traits in an OP population of E. pellita with the preselected markers. LD between a marker and the causal variant determines the additive and dominance effects observed for the marker (Aliloo et al. 2016). The additive variance observed at the marker depends upon the square of the correlation between the marker and the causal variant (r2), while the dominance variance observed at the marker depends on the r4 between the marker and causal variant. Thus, for detection of dominance effects markers that are in high LD with the causal variants are required (Wei et al. 2014). The accuracy of the models with the functional markers would persist across many generations (Habier et al. 2010)., Several studies have shown that the inclusion of dominance and trait-relevant markers improve prediction accuracies (Da et al. 2014; Beaulieu et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2019). Causal or trait-associated markers are important for the identification of dominance effects. Lenz et al. (2020) did not observe significant dominance effects using polycrosses and full-sib crosses in white spruce. While they suggested that the reason for the lack of dominance effects may be due to the small size of the population, another reason may be due to the un-selected markers used in their study. The accuracy of predicting total genetic values with causal markers is higher with a small number of causal markers than several random markers distributed across the genome (Da et al. 2014). Ramstein et al. (2020) have found that the inclusion of dominance and genic regions enriched with functional markers in prediction models improve prediction accuracies in maize hybrids. Low prediction accuracy was observed by excluding relevant markers and including irrelevant markers (Lippert et al. 2013). Klápště et al. (2020) have also shown higher accuracy of predicting traits in E. nitens and Pinus radiata using preselected markers. While these studies demonstrate the advantage of using trait-relevant markers in genomic predictions, identifying such markers is time-consuming and requires a large effort. We used high throughput methods and a discovery population consisting of trials from different sites and environments to detect trait-relevant markers. The marker panels used in this study consist of trait-relevant markers of different traits selected from thousands of markers by sequencing trait extreme samples from several trials., DBH and KPY showed significant inbreeding depression (Table 3). Of these two traits, DBH had higher inbreeding depression. Other studies have also shown inbreeding depression of growth traits in E. nitens (Hardner and Tibbits 1998; Klápště et al. 2017). Inbreeding depression depends upon directional dominance and epistasis. Inbreeding depression or heterosis occurs due to directional dominance (Falconer and Mackay 1996). A trait should be influenced by dominance effects resulting in dominance variance to exhibit inbreeding depression (Howard et al. 2017; Doekes et al. 2021). Directional dominance is when the phenotypes of heterozygous individuals differ from homozygous individuals in a consistent direction. For fitness-related traits inbreeding depression is negative i.e., fitness is reduced with the increased homozygosity (Yengo et al. 2017). Inbreeding depression of DBH may be due to directional dominance as indicated by the significant negative linear relationship between inbreeding and DBH (Table 3). Inbreeding depression in KPY may be influenced more by epistasis as indicated by the significant negative quadratic relationship between inbreeding and KPY (Table 3)., Dominance variance increases with increased inbreeding. Populations with high levels of inbreeding show a large proportion of the phenotype variation arising from dominance effects (Falconer and Mackay 1996). Misztal et al. (1997) identified higher inbreeding depression was associated with higher levels of dominance in cattle. There are two hypotheses explaining the inbreeding depression due to directional dominance. One is the partial dominance hypothesis in which deleterious recessive alleles which are masked under heterozygous condition are exposed with increased inbreeding leading to inbreeding depression. Another hypothesis is overdominance. Under this hypothesis the heterozygous condition itself is advantageous and this advantage decreases with increasing inbreeding leading to inbreeding depression (Crow and Kimura 1970; Charlesworth and Willis 2009)., It has been suggested to use inbreeding as a covariate in the genomic model to reduce the inflation of dominance variance (Vitezica et al. 2018). Inclusion of the inbreeding in the GBLUP-AD model as a fixed covariate reduced the dominance variance close to zero while not affecting the additive variance in this study (data not shown). Predictive ability with inbreeding in the GBLUP-AD model is lower (0.26—data not shown) than without the inbreeding (0.35—Figure 1). These results contrast with those of Xiang et al. (2016) who observed higher predictive ability with inbreeding in the genomic model compared to the model without the inbreeding. These results indicate that the dominance effects observed for DBH in this study are entirely due to inbreeding depression. The higher predictive ability of the GBLUP-AD model in this study may be mainly due to directional dominance effects of inbreeding depression. Including inbreeding in the genomic model absorbs the mean dominance across all loci leading to underestimation of the dominance. The dominance observed after accounting for inbreeding represents deviations of dominance effects of individual loci from mean dominance effects across all loci (Xiang et al. 2016; Doekes et al. 2020). This indicates that the dominance effects observed in this study are mainly due to mean dominance effects across the loci., Correlation between dominance deviation and inbreeding provides a better estimate of the effect of dominance on inbreeding depression (Aliloo et al. 2016). There is a strong negative correlation between dominance deviations from the GBLUP-AD model and inbreeding coefficients for DBH and KPY in this study (Table 3). Similar results were also reported by Aliloo et al. (2016) for milk production traits in dairy cows. These results suggest that the trees with poor performance have gained less from dominance while trees with higher performance gained more from dominance. Therefore, selection based on dominance effects should identify the better performing trees., A high dominance ratio (d2) was observed for DEN with the ABLUP-PR model while the estimated dominance effect was low with the GBLUP-AD model (Table 2). However, the high dominance effect of the ABLUP-PR model did not result in higher predictive abilities (Figure 1) or higher prediction accuracies (Figure 2) using dominance effects in the prediction model. Klápště et al. (2017) have also observed high dominance effects for tangential air shrinkage of wood with sib-ship reconstruction in E. nitens. They did not see improvement in the model fit or precision of genetic parameters with the dominance relationship matrix in the model. Dominance effects with ABLUP models are not widely used as pedigree relationships are not sufficient. Large full-sib families are required for accurate estimates of the dominance. Moreover, prediction of dominance with pedigree information is cumbersome as it typically involves complex computations (Vitezica et al. 2013). Munoz and Sanchez (2014) indicated that estimation of genetic parameters with pedigree models is biased and genetic marker data should be used to partition additive and dominance effects., Genetic parameters of DBH estimated with the ABLUP model using all 8821 (Table 5) trees are significantly lower than those estimated with 868 genotyped trees (Table 2). While the predictive ability has not improved, there is a large improvement in the prediction accuracy of DBH with ABLUP using all 8821 trees (Figure 4). This shows that the genetic parameters are overestimated with ABLUP using a small population with a few individuals per family compared to a large population with more individuals per family. Several studies have shown overestimation and low accuracy of the genetic parameters estimated with the ABLUP model (Muñoz et al. 2014; de Almeida Filho et al. 2019; Lenz et al. 2020). In tree breeding, most of the breeding populations are made up of shallow pedigrees with minimal connections between the families spanning only a few generations. Genetic parameters estimated with ABLUP models in such populations will be biased as only the higher-level relationships are utilized based on the pedigree information. On the other hand, the GRM used in the GBLUP captures the Mendelian segregation term among the individuals within a family as well as the hidden relationships between the families leading to higher accuracy of the genetic parameters and breeding values estimated with the GBLUP. The GBLUP, therefore, captures the contemporary as well as historical relationships leading to the high accuracy of the genetic parameters (Grattapaglia et al. 2018)., In several studies, the prediction accuracy of GBLUP is estimated by correlating MBVs with the EBVs of ABLUP. While this may be valid in animal breeding where deep pedigrees spanning several generations are used and the pedigree errors are minimal, this may not be useful in tree breeding with shallow pedigrees and several pedigree errors. Benchmarking the prediction accuracy of MBVs from GBLUP with less accurate EBVs will lead to biased estimates of the accuracy. This bias was highlighted by Klápště et al. (2018) in an OP population of E. nitens leading to a recommendation of benchmarking MBV accuracies of GBLUP with pedigree corrected EBVs of ABLUP. Even though this may result in better accuracies compared to those estimated without the pedigree correction, these accuracies are still biased. Pedigree reconstruction can only capture higher-level relationships such as half-sibs or full-sibs of a family, but within family Mendelian segregation term and lower-level relationships or the hidden relationships between families are not captured. Under these conditions, we propose benchmarking MBVs/EBVs from cross-validation with the MBVs estimated using all the samples used in the study as GRM captures all kinds of relationships including the hidden relationships. The MBVs estimated with all samples used in a study will therefore be closer to the true breeding values. In a recent study, Lenz et al. (2020) employed this approach to estimate the accuracies in white spruce., Among all the four models using 8821 trees, ssGBLUP-IBS had the highest heritability (Table 5). While the estimates of heritability with ssGBLUP-IBS are higher than GBLUP-IBS, they are slightly lower for ssGBLUP-IBD compared to the GBLUP-IBD model (Tables 2 and 5). However, the predictive abilities and prediction accuracies of ssGBLUP models with 8821 trees (Figure 4) are similar to that of GBLUP models with 868 genotyped trees (Figure 1). While the ssGBLUP model did not result in higher predictive ability or higher prediction accuracy compared to GBLUP, there is a steady increase in the theoretical accuracy of ssGBLUP compared to the GBLUP models (data not shown). Among the four models (ssGBLUP-IBS, ssGBLUP-IBD, ABLUP-PR, and ABLUP), ssGBLUP-IBS had the highest theoretical accuracy among the three groups of the samples (parents, genotyped, and nongenotyped, Table 6). With ssGBLUP-IBS, accuracy has improved even in nongenotyped samples whereas the accuracy among the nongenotyped samples is similar between the other three models (ssGBLUP-IBD, ABLUP-PR, and ABLUP). The high heritability of ssGBLUP-IBS may reflect the improvement in the theoretical accuracy of DBH with ssGBLUP-IBS compared to the other three models. We observed similar results in an OP population of E. pellita (Thavamanikumar et al. 2020). These results are in contrast to the results of a study using an OP population in E. nitens (Klápště et al. 2018). In their study, no improvement in theoretical accuracy was observed among the parents and nongenotyped samples with ssGBLUP models compared to the ABLUP model. The lack of improvement in the accuracy was attributed to the pedigree errors and undetected hidden relationships among the nongenotyped samples. Higher theoretical accuracy of parents and nongenotyped samples with ssGBLUP-IBS in this study may be due to higher and more accurate estimates of heritability estimated with the preselected markers., Theoretical accuracies reflect how much an individual’s breeding value improves with more data (Bijma 2012), while the prediction accuracies reflect the ability of the model to predict samples without the phenotype data. The similar prediction accuracy within the genotyped samples of ssGBLUP models compared to the GBLUP models may be due to the small proportion of genotyped samples compared to the total samples in ssGBLUP and the usage of a population with a shallow pedigree with minimal connectedness between the families. Another important factor could be pedigree errors. While pedigree errors in genotyped samples have been corrected, errors among nongenotyped samples may lead to biased estimates. In animal breeding where ssGBLUP is widely used pedigree errors are generally low. Moreover, genotype data from several thousand animals is available. Under these conditions ssGBLUP yields higher accuracy compared to GBLUP. Therefore, the accuracy of ssGBLUP in tree breeding may be improved by increasing the proportion of the genotyped samples and using breeding populations with deep pedigrees spanning several generations with several families. Ratcliffe et al. (2017) have shown increased improvement in the model fit, precision of genetic parameters, and breeding value accuracy with the increased proportion of the samples genotyped., In a recent study, Jurcic et al. (2021) have shown that implementation of a ssGBLUP with IBD relationship matrix resulted in better performance compared to a ssGBLUP model with IBS GRM in E. dunnii. Higher predictive ability was observed with IBD compared to the IBS matrix for DBH and stem straightness. They advocate the use of the IBD matrix in ssGBLUP analyses in OP tree evaluation. In this study, we compared the performance of the IBD and IBS matrices with GBLUP and ssGBLUP models. The predictive ability of IBS is higher than IBD with both GBLUP (Figure 1) and ssGBLUP (Figure 4) models even though these differences are not statistically significant. However, while the prediction accuracy is similar between the two matrices with GBLUP, there is a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the ssGBLUP-IBD model compared to the ssGBLUP-IBS model (Figure 4). Heritability and the theoretical accuracies estimated with ssGBLUP-IBS are higher than those with the ssGBLUP-IBD model. Moreover, the precision of the ssGBLUP-IBS model is better than the ssGBLUP-IBD model (Table 5). However, the dispersion of pair-wise relationship coefficients of ssGBLUP-IBD is lower than the ssGBLUP-IBS model (Table 4). While the high heritability of ssGBLUP-IBS, low dispersion of relationship coefficients of ssGBLUP-IBD and high prediction accuracy of ssGBLUP-IBD model are similar to the results of Jurcic et al. (2021), there is however no difference between the two models in predictive ability with both GBLUP (Figure 1) and ssGBLUP (Figure 4). The discrepancy in the performance of the models with IBD in the current study and the previous study may be due to the type of population and the type of markers used in the two studies. The breeding population used in this study consisted of parents and progeny from both CP and OP families while in the previous study an OP population was used. Parents of the progeny are also genotyped in this study. IBS based GS tracks information from many generations of pedigree leading to higher accuracy of IBS compared to IBD which is restricted to the documented pedigree (Luan et al. 2012). The relatively deep pedigree used in our study may be the reason for the better performance of the IBS matrix. Another issue may be LD or the marker-trait associations (functional variants) captured by the markers which leads to higher accuracy of IBS over IBD in GS models (Vela-Avitúa et al. 2015). The functional markers within the marker panel used in the current study may have contributed to improved performance of the IBS matrix over the IBD matrix in terms of predictive ability of GBLUP and ssGBLUP models; and the theoretical accuracy of the ssGBLUP model., Detection of significant dominance effects has practical implications in tree breeding. In tree species that can be vegetatively propagated, whole genotypic values which include both additive and dominance effects can be used in selection to transfer them to the next generation (de Almeida Filho et al. 2019). Dominance is also crucial for selecting complementary parents to exploit heterosis (de Almeida Filho et al. 2016). In species such as E. nitens where vegetative propagation is difficult, dominance can be used to select complementary parents for crossing. Optimal mate allocation involves selecting complementary parents to improve the genetic merit (which includes both additive and dominance effects) of the progeny. Simulation studies have shown substantial improvement in selection response with mate allocation techniques based on genomic models with dominance effects. However, the extra response is only observed in the first generation of mating and thereafter it is not further improved but maintained (Toro and Varona 2010). Mate allocation methods employing nonadditive effects will reduce the inbreeding in the progeny (Aliloo et al. 2017). In E. nitens controlled crossing between individual parents is difficult. Therefore, a polycross mating system is used to generate CP families with a pollen mix (polymix) collected from several parents. Even when full-sib crosses are possible, no advantage is found with full-sib crosses compared to polycrosses (Lenz et al. 2020). The total genotypic values (MGVs) of the parents may be used for generating CP families with improved progeny performance. In this study, among the top ten parents with the highest MGVs for DBH, one parent (maternal) has genotyped progeny. All the progeny derived from this parent have high MGVs (data not shown) indicating the inheritance of the dominance effects by the progeny. Controlled crossing among the top parents with the highest MGVs should, therefore, result in progeny with high MGVs and improved genetic performance., In this study, we observed significant dominance effects controlling DBH with preselected markers containing trait-relevant markers. Higher predictive abilities and higher total genotypic value accuracies were observed using prediction models with dominance effects. The performance of the models with IBS and IBD relationship matrices was similar within the genotyped samples using GBLUP. The prediction accuracy of IBD in ssGBLUP was higher than IBS. However, the theoretical accuracy of the ssGBLUP model with the IBS matrix is higher than the ssGBLUP model with the IBD matrix and ABLUP models. Improvement in theoretical accuracy was observed for nongenotyped samples and parents with the ssGBLUP-IBS model compared to other models. Significant inbreeding depression was observed for DBH and KPY. A linear relationship was observed between inbreeding and DBH while a nonlinear quadratic relationship was observed between inbreeding and KPY. This suggests that directional dominance contributes to the inbreeding depression of DBH while epistasis may be an important factor contributing to the inbreeding depression of KPY. The dominance effects observed for DBH in this study are mainly due to inbreeding depression. The significant dominance effect of DBH observed in this study may be used in mate allocation programs to select complementary parents to generate superior progeny., The pedigree and trait data used in this study are in Supplementary Table S1.

If a newly proposed GSA tool is to be evaluated, we recommend the incorporation of a wide range of multivariate non-normal distributions or sampling from large databases if available., Gene-set analysis (GSA) is one of the standard procedures used in biomedical research when interest lies in the evaluation of certain biological functions, such as pathways, or of the collective effect of a set of genes on disease status, phenotype, or other response variables (Hirschhorn 2009; Mooney et al. 2014). The development of the methodology for performing GSA has attracted much attention in the biostatistics and bioinformatics communities in recent decades. Most GSA methods are applied to pathways as a way of evaluating and testing pathway association. Findings in GSAs can provide a better understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential treatment targets, particularly for complex diseases (Subramanian et al. 2005; Hirschhorn 2009; Mooney et al. 2014). Results from the procedures can save time, cost, and effort in translational studies., When used for pathway analysis, it is common to categorize GSA methods into three classes: Over representation analysis, functional class scoring (FCS), and pathway topology methods. Several studies have reviewed and compared these different GSA categories (Goeman and Buhlmann 2007; Ackermann and Strimmer 2009; Gatti et al. 2010; Khatri et al. 2012; Maciejewski 2014; de Leeuw et al. 2016). The over representation analysis approach is concerned with determining if the differentially expressed (DE) genes are overrepresented (or enriched) in a candidate gene-set/pathway; that is, if the number of DE genes in the set is beyond chance alone. When this is the goal, an over representation analysis test is carried out based on the hypergeometric distribution, chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test (Boyle et al. 2004). Whether the RNA values follow a normal distribution does not affect the over representation analysis test in the step of enrichment evaluation. The over representation analysis approach is intuitive and is still a widely used procedure to screen for potential targeted pathways from a list of known ones, thus it is often called a knowledge-based procedure. A major limitation of over representation analysis, however, is that it ignores the relationship among genes in the set of interest and considers them equally important., The FCS approach aims to examine the collective and coordinated effect of the gene-set/pathway. It calculates a score at the pathway level based on a statistic evaluated at each individual component gene, whether it is DE or not. Most FCSs consider the score a weighted sum of the gene-level statistics, where the weight usually represents the interrelationship among the genes. The advantages of FCSs are the inclusion of genes that may not be significant at the single gene level, the incorporation of the dependence among genes, and the potential to compare contributions of different pathways. More discussion of various FCS methods is included in Section 3. The third category, the pathway topology methods, such as SPIA (Draghici et al. 2007), NetGSA (Shojaie and Michailidis 2009), and NetworkHub (Chang et al. 2020), all involve a known topological structure of the genes, and therefore can be applied only if the structure of the set of genes is already determined. This limits the application of pathway topology methods to established biological pathways. Consequently, it becomes difficult to evaluate their performance with simulation studies since the biological structure is required as input in pathway topology methods., Several review articles have documented the evolution of GSA tools (Ackermann and Strimmer 2009; Maciejewski 2014; de Leeuw et al. 2016), with emphasis on their differences, assumptions, and statistical properties; some have also addressed issues that arise in GSA, including the lack of consideration of linkage disequilibrium (or correlation) between genes (Goeman and Buhlmann 2007; Gatti et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2018), the choice of null hypothesis (competitive or self-contained tests) (Goeman and Buhlmann 2007; Maciejewski 2014; de Leeuw et al. 2016), and the influence of the proportion of associated genes in the set (Maciejewski 2014; de Leeuw et al. 2016). A few studies have expressed doubts about the distributional assumptions made about the data (Kerr et al. 2000; Konishi 2004; Zyla et al. 2017). Whether or not the transcriptomic data are normally distributed has not been resolved, even though it has been noted that heterogeneity in the profiling values may exist due to disease subtypes (Konishi 2004; Zyla et al. 2017; Ho 2018; de Torrenté et al., 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Kerr et al. 2000). Nevertheless, no study that we are aware of has investigated the impact of distributional assumptions on the conclusions of GSA when the gene-set exerts a certain molecular function or activity., The commonly adopted distributional assumptions for gene expression data are the multivariate normal (MVN) or log-normal distribution. Despite doubts about this assumption, these distributions are frequently used to generate expression values in simulation studies when evaluating the performance of a newly proposed GSA tool, especially those GSAs categorized as FCS methods. In other words, many GSA tools inherently assume that the gene expression data are normally or log-normally distributed, or that the GSA tests are robust to the distributional assumptions. Since the normality assumption may not be true or guaranteed (Kerr et al. 2000; Konishi 2004; Zyla et al. 2017), such simulation-based assessment of GSA tools may be incomprehensive, leading to possibly spurious findings., Whether or not the assumed distribution is appropriate may affect the applicability of GSA methods. The performance in terms of statistical power, for instance, may be affected when the data deviate from normality. If the power of the GSA tests is reduced when the RNA values follow a non-normal distribution, then it is possible that the gene-set/pathway associated with the response variable cannot be identified. To what extent the change in performance corresponds to the deviation requires further examination. The GSA methods that are mean-based (de Leeuw et al. 2016) may be able to guard against this issue if the size of the gene-set, the number of genes, is small enough relative to the number of samples for asymptotic normality to apply. For nonparametric GSA tests, it is not yet known how robust they are with respect to incorrect distributional assumptions., Therefore, the two goals of this study are, first, to investigate the goodness-of-fit of the MVN distribution for the gene expression data and, second, to evaluate the performance of common FCS GSA methods in response to the deviation of the normality assumption. In the first part of this study, we will examine whether the parametric MVN distribution is a suitable assumption for gene expression values in the real world. To assess if the multi-dimensional data set at hand fits an MVN distribution, many tests have been proposed in the literature and several articles have presented comparisons and reviews of them (Thode 2002; Mecklin and Mundfrom 2005, 2004; Korkmaz et al. 2014; Chen and Xia 2019). Based on their recommendations, six tests are considered: the Mardia test (Mardia 1970), the Henze-Zirkler (HZ) test (Henze and Zirkler 1990), the Royston test (Royston 1992), the Fattorini (FA) test (Fattorini 1986; Lee et al. 2014), the TN test (Zhou and Shao 2014), and the Energy test (Székely and Rizzo 2005). These MVN tests will be applied to three types of RNA values, including microarray, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data., The second goal of this study is to compare the performance of several FCS GSA tools, with emphasis on the impact of the distributional assumption, based on data generated from MVN and non-normal distributions. The objective of these GSAs is to examine if a gene-set associates with a response variable, that is, if the gene-set shows a collective effect on the outcome variable, such as disease status, disease subtype or some continuous phenotypic value. Here, we consider specifically the GSA tools in the FCS group. In addition, we categorize the tools in this group into two different subgroups, parametric and nonparametric GSAs. The parametric GSA tools were developed mostly based on known statistical distributions and models, including the random-effects global test (Goeman et al. 2004), Hotelling’s statistic (Lu et al. 2005; Schafer and Strimmer 2005), and ROAST (Wu et al. 2010) in an MVN model, and the pathway activity score (P-score) in a logistic regression model (Lin et al. 2018). The nonparametric GSA methods mostly use the ranks of gene expression levels to reduce the heterogeneity in the absolute values across different genes. Several popular nonparametric methods are gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al. 2005), the N-statistic (Baringhaus and Franz 2004; Klebanov et al. 2007; Glazko and Emmert-Streib 2009), and the Kolmogrov–Smirnov test for the mean vector and the Kolmogrov–Smirnov test for the covariance matrix (Rahmatallah et al. 2017). These GSA tools for association studies will be investigated to evaluate their performance under different distributional assumptions that deviate from MVN., To investigate if MVN fits gene expression data, three types of RNA values, including microarray, RNA-seq, and scRNA-seq data, are considered for examination. Twenty-two microarray data sets and the RNA-seq data were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) websites, and the scRNA-seq data (Tucker et al. 2020) were downloaded from the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal. Many of the microarray gene expression data sets were from cancer [breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and glioblastoma (GBM)] patients; four sets were from cancer-free patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), two of smokers and two of nonsmokers. The RNA sequencing data from the NCBI were collected from breast cancer patients and normal controls; and the single-cell RNA sequencing data were from human donors without any clinical evidence of cardiac dysfunction., Each of the microarray data sets was processed with the Robust Multi-array method (R function rma in R package affy) and quantile normalization (R function normalize.quantiles in R package preprocessCore) for data processing. Next, considering that expression levels are affected by age, gender, ethnicity, cancer grade and stage, these downloaded data were stratified according to these factors, if available, and then the groups containing a larger number of samples were selected for the following analyses. For instance, in the first data set (Ni et al. 2010), only breast cancer patients who were in grades II and III and were also Malaysian Malays were selected. In the second data set (Sabates-Bellver et al. 2007), the 23 colorectal cancer patients with tumors found in the rectum or sigmoid colon were selected from a study originally containing 32 patients. In the GBM study in the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2008), only male patients aged beyond 50 and diagnosed with one of the four subtypes of GBM were selected. Table 1 lists for the RNA array data the type of cancer or disease, the accession number in the NCBI data portal or TCGA identification, the source of the sample (tissue, cell, or peripheral blood), the platform (Affymetrix GPL96/HG-U133A, Affymetrix GPL570/HG-U133plus2, or multiple platforms from Affymetrix and Agilent) used for obtaining the expression levels, the sample type (paired or independent), the number of samples in each group, and the selection criteria used to select samples., Description of the 22 microarray RNA data sets considered for the MVN tests, The gene expression data are either from cancer patients (case), from subjects without cancer or from adjacent normal tissues (control).

The normalized read counts of the expression values from 16,532 genes can be downloaded from the NCBI (accession number GSE69240) website. The expression values for the following analysis are on a logarithmic scale with base 2., The scRNA-seq data were collected from seven donors who did not have overt cardiac disease (Tucker et al. 2020). This study sequenced 287,269 nuclei from normal heart tissue of the four chambers (left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle) and identified 9 major cell types and more than 20 subclusters of cell types within the human heart. The grouping of these subclusters will be retained in the following analysis to reduce heterogeneity across clusters., Six methods in three categories are considered for the MVN test. The first category includes two tests based on the distance measure between the p-dimensional data and the p-variate normal distribution, the Energy test and the HZ test. The distance measure used in Energy is the Euclidean distance and in HZ it is the expected distance between two characteristic functions. The second category contains three tests which are all multivariate extensions of the univariate SW test: the Royston test which combines the SW statistic from each of the p coordinates, and the FA and TN tests which are based on projection of the multivariate data onto a one-dimensional point, where FA and TN utilize different statistics of the projected values. The test in the third group is the traditional Mardia test based on multivariate skewness or kurtosis. We consider any violation in either one as a deviation from MVN and therefore the Mardia test was applied here to test if either the skewness or kurtosis test reached significance at the 5% nominal level. Some background information about the six MVN tests is provided in Supplementary File S1., All the tests were carried out in R, with the function mvnorm.etest in the R package energy for the one (multivariate) sample Energy test (Székely and Rizzo 2017), with the function mvn in the R package MVN for the HZ, Royston, and Mardia tests (Korkmaz et al. 2014) and with the functions faTest and mvnTest in the R package mvnormalTest for the Fattorini FA and TN tests (Lee et al. 2014), respectively., To test the gene sets for MVN, 10 signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were selected deliberately. These signaling pathways were constructed based on interacting molecules involving specific biological functions, where the gene nodes in the pathway network (gene-set) would be expected to exert some correlation. Such pathways targeted by GSA therefore are the focus of our examination of the normality test. The 10 signaling pathways defined in KEGG are the p53, mTOR, Jak-STAT, PI3k-Akt, Wnt, ErbB, MAPK, RAS, TGF-β, and TNF pathways, which contain 60, 69, 32, 85, 76, 47, 115, 69, 58, and 82 gene nodes, respectively. These have been reported to associate with one or more of the cancers considered here. For example, the p53 pathway was reported to show association with breast (Gasco et al. 2002; Bertheau et al. 2008; Walerych et al. 2012), colorectal (Li et al. 2015), lung (Mitsudomi et al. 2000; Shtivelman et al. 2014), ovarian (Bernardini et al. 2010; Hayano et al. 2014), and GBM (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2008; Jung et al. 2019) cancers. Association of the other pathways such as mTOR, Jak-STAT, PI3k-Akt, Wnt, RAS, and TGF-β have been reported as well (Park and Kim 2007; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2008; Eroles et al. 2012; Shtivelman et al. 2014; Slattery et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2018; Jung et al. 2019). For the COPD studies, the pathways reported to associate with the disease or smoking status include Jak-STAT (Bahr et al. 2013; Yew-Booth et al. 2015; Nicholson et al. 2016), PI3k-Akt (Marwick et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2011; Bahr et al. 2013; Mercado et al. 2015), and mTor (Bahr et al. 2013; Mercado et al. 2015)., The expression values of genes in the above pathways were extracted from microarray RNA and RNA-seq for the MVN tests. For the scRNA-seq data, since most scRNA-seq data are sparse, we selected the top 100 most variable genes for the MVN tests so that the inversion of the covariance matrix, calculated in some of the tests, would not be singular. The MVN tests were carried out for each of the four chambers and each of the subclusters, since the single-cells identified in the same chamber or subcluster were considered function similarly and thus contain less variability (Tucker et al. 2020)., Among the FSC GSA tools we considered here, the first group of them contains four parametric tests: the global test (Goeman et al. 2004), Hotelling’s statistic (Schafer and Strimmer 2005; Lu et al. 2005), ROAST (Wu et al. 2010), and the pathway activity score (P-score) in the logistic regression model (Lin et al. 2018). The global test examines the existence of heterogeneity among the random gene effects under a parametric generalized linear model. The function gt in the R package Globaltest performs this test. The Hotelling’s T2 statistic compares the mean vectors of the expression profiles from subjects of different disease statuses with a modified estimate of the covariance matrix to incorporate possible correlation among genes. This test can be performed in the R package Hotelling with the function hotelling.test. The ROAST method is also constructed under the linear model. It combines the gene-level modified t-statistic to formulate a statistic for the gene-set, and determines the P-value, not via permutation of genes or samples, but by the rotation of the independent residual space to incorporate the intergenic correlations (Langsrud 2005). The function roast in the R package limma performs this test. The pathway activity score, P-score, is a statistic based on ranks of gene expression values and magnitudes of correlations (Lin et al. 2018). The score is computed for each sample and the enrichment analysis for association with the response variable is then tested in a logistic regression model under the case-control study design., The second group contains nonparametric FCS GSA tests which utilize mostly the ranks of the expression values or some metric of the distance between genes. The first one we considered is the popular GSEA modified for the self-contained null hypothesis for a predetermined set of genes (Gentleman et al. 2008). It is nonparametric in the sense that no distributional assumption is made for the expression value and the test statistic is based on the ranks of the degree of association between the response and the individual gene. It assumes independence among gene expression profiles and utilizes rankings and nonparametric distance metrics to derive P-values. This test can be carried out with the function gseattperm in the R package Category. The second test, usually called the N-statistic, compares the Euclidean distance between multivariate observations from two response groups (Baringhaus and Franz 2004; Klebanov et al. 2007; Glazko and Emmert-Streib 2009). It follows the same rationale as in the energy test in previous sections for MVN tests, where a group of observations is compared against observations generated from a MVN distribution. Here for GSA, the focus is on the comparison between two groups of multivariate observations without distributional assumptions for either group. This test can be conducted with the function eqdist.etest in the R package energy (Székely and Rizzo 2017). The other two GSA tools considered here first rank the multivariate samples based on the minimum spanning tree and then use the multivariate Kolmogorov–Smirnov test under the self-contained null hypothesis to test for the difference in mean, or in variance (Rahmatallah et al. 2017). The R package adopted here is GSAR and the functions are KStest and RKStest, respectively. All the software and functions used in this study are listed in Table 2., Software (R package; function) used for assessing the performance of the FCS GSA tools, Software (R package; function) used for assessing the performance of the FCS GSA tools, To evaluate the performance of these GSA tools with respect to different distributions of the gene expression values, the following scenarios were considered. The first two are single-component models. Simulation setting A was designed under the p-dimensional MVN assumption (P = 30), where both response groups, termed as case and control with 50 subjects in each group, were generated from MVN distributions with different mean vectors (the difference is denoted as Δ˜⁠) and the same compound symmetry covariance matrix (with ρ = 0.1)., Setting B aims for a larger heterogeneity than A and the data were instead generated from multivariate t distributions (MVT) with 3 degrees of freedom, the same mean vectors as in A and a compound symmetry covariance matrix with ρ = 0.5., In this setting, we consider distributions containing more variation than the above scenario by assuming a mixture of two distributions. In setting C, the expression values were randomly generated from a mixture of two MVN distributions, each with 50% weight. Specifically, in the control group, the mean vectors of the two component MVNs are the zero mean vector 0˜ and the vector of all-ones 1˜⁠, respectively; while in the case group, the two mean vectors are 0˜+Δ˜ and 1˜+Δ˜⁠, respectively., In setting D, the variability in each component is made even larger by assuming a MVT distribution with 3 degrees of freedom., In contrast to the previous scenarios where both case and control groups are from the same distribution but with different means, here we consider the scenario where the disease (case) group contains more than one component distribution. These situations can arise due to disease subtypes such as cancer grade, staging, and tumor tissue type (Kim et al. 2010). Examples include lung cancer with two major subtypes, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and leukemia with four major subtypes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The therapeutic choice may differ according to different subtypes where such classification is usually performed clinically with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Therefore, in settings E and F, the distribution for the case group is a 2-component mixture of normal distributions (setting E) and a 2-component mixture of t distributions (setting F), respectively; whereas in settings G and H, it is a 3-component mixture distribution. Table 3 lists all the distributions considered in these simulation studies., Distributions used to generate expression data in the GSA analysis, MVN stands for the MVN distribution and MVT stands for multivariate t distribution. The two covariance matrices adopted both have compound symmetry correlation structure where the correlation is 0.1 in Σ1 and 0.5 in Σ2⁠, respectively. The KL divergence measures the distance between the distribution based on simulated data and the MVN Npwith zero mean vector and an identity covariance matrix. All vectors (⁠0˜⁠, Δ˜⁠, and 1˜⁠) are 30-dimensional and matrices (⁠Σ1 and Σ2⁠) are 30 by 30., The sum of the KL divergence between the case and Np⁠, and the KL divergence between the control and Np⁠. KL divergence was computed with the function KL.dist in the R package FNN., Distributions used to generate expression data in the GSA analysis, MVN stands for the MVN distribution and MVT stands for multivariate t distribution. The two covariance matrices adopted both have compound symmetry correlation structure where the correlation is 0.1 in Σ1 and 0.5 in Σ2⁠, respectively. The KL divergence measures the distance between the distribution based on simulated data and the MVN Npwith zero mean vector and an identity covariance matrix. All vectors (⁠0˜⁠, Δ˜⁠, and 1˜⁠) are 30-dimensional and matrices (⁠Σ1 and Σ2⁠) are 30 by 30., The sum of the KL divergence between the case and Np⁠, and the KL divergence between the control and Np⁠. KL divergence was computed with the function KL.dist in the R package FNN., The use of mixture distributions for tumor subtypes incorporates the scenario of skewed distributions which are apparently non-normally distributed (Kim et al. 2010). To demonstrate the degree of deviation from normality, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted to measure the distance between the distribution of the simulated data and Np⁠, a MVN distribution with a zero mean vector and an identity covariance matrix, in each setting. The values are listed in the right-most column in Table 3. Larger values of KL divergence imply a greater difference between the group with the simulated distribution and the group with a MVN distribution., Since MVN will not hold true for the distribution of any pathway if any subset of the pathway deviates from the normality assumption, we selected a subset of either 10 (if the number of samples exceeds 30) or 5 (if the number is below 30) genes from each pathway (for the array RNA and RNA-seq data) or from each chamber or subcluster (for the scRNA-seq data) and carried out the above six MVN tests. This procedure was repeated 1000 times and the rejection rate, the proportion Q=#{pi≤0.05}/1000 of replications in which the P-value pi (i=1,…,1000) was less than the nominal 0.05, was recorded. If the RNA values are in fact normally distributed, then the rejection rates Q’s would be around 0.05, since the P-values under the null hypothesis follow a uniform distribution., For each of the six MVN tests, the majority of the Q’s (across data sets and pathways/subclusters) are much greater than 5% as shown in the boxplots in Figure 1A when analyzing the microarray RNA values. This implies strong evidence of a non-MVN distribution. Details of these proportions are provided in the online supplementary materials (Supplementary Tables S1–S6). Another presentation in Figure 1B displays the average of the Q’s across the ten signaling pathways for each data set. The heatmap again demonstrates noticeable evidence against the normality assumption, as well as similarity in the rates of rejecting the MVN null hypothesis among the six tests. The corresponding average values are listed in the supplementary materials (Supplementary Table S7). For MVN tests with RNA-seq data in the 10 pathways, the top leading five and bottom five average Q are selected and the P-values generating the Q’s are presented in negative log-scale in a quantile–quantile plot in Figure 1C. The apparent deviation from the straight line in the plot strongly supports the existence of a non-MVN distribution for the RNA-seq values. For the scRNA-seq values of the human heart left ventricle, the same pattern is observed in Figure 1D for the subclusters. It is apparent that even the bottom five average Q’s (the five smallest rejection rates) are derived from very small P-values (blue symbols in Figure 1D), again implying significant and strong evidence of non-normality for the subclusters. The plots of the other three chambers demonstrate the same pattern and are displayed in the online supplementary material (Supplementary Figure S1)., Results for the RNA empirical data under each of the six MVN tests.

Red symbols are the P-values composing the top five leading rejection rates Q⁠; while the blue symbols are P-values composing the bottom five Q⁠., In addition, these six tests are fairly consistent with each other since their corresponding rejection rates (⁠Q’s) are highly correlated. As indicated in the scatter plot in Figure 2A for the microarray RNA values, the Q’s show strong positive correlation, ranging between 0.85 and 0.90 as listed in the correlation plot in Figure 2B. When comparing the other MVN tests against the Energy test, the x-axis in Figure 2A, the scatter plot reveals that the Royston test tends to reject more often than the Energy test (indicated by points above the diagonal line); while both the HZ and Mardia tests are more conservative than the Energy test (points below the diagonal line). As for the FA and TN tests, their performance is relatively closer to that of the Energy test (points are close to the line). The pattern remains the same when investigating the RNA-seq data. In Figure 2C, the points contain the rejection rates from the tests on 10 pathways with data from cancer-free subjects and cancer patients, respectively. Though there are only 20 points in this subfigure, these rejection rates (⁠Q’s) are still much larger than 5% and show the same positive correlation as in Figure 2A. For scRNA-seq, the results are demonstrated in Figure 2D. Since the P-values are very small, the corresponding rejection rates are all very close to 1, even those of the Mardia test are still much larger than 5%., Rejection rates Q under different MVN tests when applied to different RNA empirical data.

The next task was to examine if the non-normality affects the results from current gene set analysis methods. The following simulation studies are designed to mimic the case where the expression values are from a single-component distribution or from a mixture of more than one component distribution, for each of the two response groups termed as the case and control group. The distributions are all multi-dimensional containing weak and moderate correlation between gene expressions. The FCS GSAs are then performed and compared., In each of the three simulation settings, the difference in the mean of the two groups is denoted as Δ˜=(Δ,Δ,…,Δ,)⁠, where Δ is set at 0 to evaluate the false positive rate (type I error rate) and set at 0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7, and 0.9 to evaluate its power performance. A total of 1000 replications were carried out under each setting, where each replication contained 50 control subjects and 50 disease (case) subjects. Three selective results from setting A, D, and H are shown in Figure 3, A–C, respectively. The results of other settings are shown in the Supplementary Figure S2 and Tables S8–S15., Power curves (when Δ > 0) of the eight GSA tools under selected simulation settings A, D, and H. When Δ= 0, the y-axis denotes the type I error rates. KS_mean and KS_var stand for the Kolmogrov–Smirnov test for the mean vector and for the covariance matrix, respectively. (A) Setting A, 1-component MVN vs 1-component MVN. (B) Setting D, 2-component mixture MVT vs 2-component mixture MVT. (C) Setting H, 1-component MVT vs 3-component mixture MVT., Power curves (when Δ > 0) of the eight GSA tools under selected simulation settings A, D, and H. When Δ= 0, the y-axis denotes the type I error rates. KS_mean and KS_var stand for the Kolmogrov–Smirnov test for the mean vector and for the covariance matrix, respectively. (A) Setting A, 1-component MVN vs 1-component MVN. (B) Setting D, 2-component mixture MVT vs 2-component mixture MVT. (C) Setting H, 1-component MVT vs 3-component mixture MVT., Generally, all tests maintain a reasonable type I error rate at the nominal level 0.05 (when Δ = 0), and their power curves rise as expected when the mean difference Δ increases. When comparing across the three subfigures, it is noticeable that the rate of increase of the power curves in setting A (Figure 3A) is fastest, followed by that in setting D (Figure 3B), and then setting H (Figure 3C). For instance, when Δ = 0.3, five out of the eight powers in Figure 3A are larger than 0.8; while all powers at Δ = 0.3 in Figure 3B are below 0.6 and below 0.4 in Figure 3C. This is not surprising because the simulated values in setting A are all from a MVN distribution, and the distance between the empirical distribution and MVN is the smallest, as measured by the KL divergence (Table 3). In contrast, the empirical distribution of the simulated values in the other two settings D and H is not that close to MVN., The results from other settings reveal similar findings. For instance, the power performance under a single-component MVT distribution or a mixture of more than 1 MVT component, is always worse than that with MVN as the component distribution (Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, the pattern across settings A, C, and G, or across B, D, and F, remains the same as that in Figure 3., When comparing these GSA tools in each subfigure in Figure 3 and in Supplementary Figure S2, we note that the global test and ROAST in the category of parametric GSAs and the GSEA and N-statistic in the nonparametric category perform better than the others. These four tools steadily outperform the rest, with the N-statistic standing out when the component distributions are MVT rather than MVN. In other words, the N-statistic is less sensitive to the normality assumption than the other GSA tools., The findings in the first part of this study indicated strong evidence for rejecting the MVN distributional assumption for all three types of RNA values. The findings in the simulation studies in the second part further concluded that deviation from MVN can cause statistical power loss. This implies that using MVN simulated data may be a poor choice for benchmarking FCS tools. Among the GSA FCS tools examined, the nonparametric N-statistic performed comparatively well, at least in the limited scenarios investigated here. In other words, when RNA values come from subjects of different disease subtypes, the N-statistic is recommended for GSA., However, there are limitations to this study. First, the simulations in the second part included either a single-component multivariate t-distribution or a mixture of distributions to denote the non-normally distributed populations. These choices may not represent well the true distributions of the biological data. Because the true distributions are usually unknown, the pattern of their non-normality can go beyond the cases considered here. In other words, unless all forms of non-normality can be defined and have undergone the same investigation as in this study, the results here cannot guarantee that the N-statistic will perform the best in those cases. A new GSA method that is robust to distributional assumptions remains in need of development. Until then, one solution in practice would be to try different GSAs and perform validation studies if there is consensus., The second limitation to this study is the lack of measuring the degree of departure from normality, and hence this study did not identify a relationship between the degree of deviation and the loss of power of the GSAs. Traditional measurements include skewness, kurtosis, KL divergence, and Royston’s indices (Royston 1991), where each accounts for a type of non-normality. Future studies may focus on each of these and establish the trend of power loss in response to different degrees of departure. In this study, the mixture of distributions was adopted to represent the existence of sub-populations and it may not be proper to measure the skewness and kurtosis for these multi-mode distributions. The KL divergence between these mixture distributions and MVN, however, did not show a clear pattern. A more careful design of the simulated data would be needed in order to clarify the relationship between the relaxation of the distributional assumption and the performance of the FCS GSAs., There are other issues in the development of GSAs requiring attention. First, since current statistical models may not describe properly the distribution of gene expression data under study (de Torrenté et al. 2019), a remedy for the simulation design may be to simulate from available databases where the sample size is big enough to cover the heterogeneity across individuals to serve as a pseudo-population. Similar ideas have been adopted by others (Lin et al. 2018). This solution may not be readily put into practice now, but it is not entirely infeasible. As long as data accumulation continues at a high speed and access remains open to users, such a choice should be available in the near future. Second, the GSA tools we consider here are limited to the FCS category. The GSAs in the over representation analysis category do not rely on the distributional assumption of the RNA values but rather on whether the genes are DE. Therefore, these GSAs are less affected by the MVN assumption and hence not discussed here. The third issue is, currently many new GSA methods are being developed based on given pathway topology (Draghici et al. 2007; Shojaie and Michailidis 2009; Chang et al. 2020). Most of these tools do not incorporate probabilistic randomness and statistical models, thus it is not easy to investigate their performance using statistical simulation studies to test their robustness against distributional assumptions. Effort would be required by the statistical community to formulate procedures for such evaluation. Finally, current GSA methods treat the gene-set or pathway as a deterministic group of genes. No uncertainty is considered, nor quantified. However, when the content of a pathway is retrieved from different pathway databases, it is quite possible that the derived pathways are different. Future development of GSA tools should incorporate this difference, either by taking the intersection or union of these component nodes, or by including a mechanism such as latent variables for this difference.

We also evaluated expression patterns of alternative germline genes for future gene-drive designs., Mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles serve as vectors for Plasmodium parasites, the etiological agents of malaria. Malaria is the most devastating vector-borne disease worldwide, affecting more than 225 million people yearly, especially across Sub-Saharan Africa and India (World Health Organization 2020). Classic vector control strategies, such as insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying (Lengeler 2004; Pluess et al. 2010), have been applied successfully over the past two decades in endemic areas to reduce the disease burden by nearly 50%. Despite this progress, the downward trend in malarial cases has stalled and perhaps is reversing (World Health Organization 2020). Thus, there is a pressing need for new technologies to stay on track in the global malaria eradication agenda. One promising genetic approach is the development of species-specific CRISPR gene drives with the autonomous capacity to spread throughout native mosquito populations. Gene drives can be employed either to suppress mosquito populations (Hammond et al. 2016; Kyrou et al. 2018; Pham et al. 2019) or to replace disease-susceptible wild-type mosquitoes with disease-resistant individuals carrying antimalarial effectors (Adolfi et al. 2020; Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020). Biasing inheritance of a favorable genetic trait was conceived originally in the context of balanced translocations (Curtis 1968) and extended to selfish genetic elements to reshape the genetic makeup of wild insect populations (Burt 2003). However, practical implementation of such strategies has not been feasible until recently, following the application of CRISPR-Cas genome-editing technologies to develop self-copying gene-drives in insects (Gantz and Bier 2015). Currently, such CRISPR-based drive systems are being explored to control populations of animals that vector disease (Adolfi et al. 2020; Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020), impact biodiversity (Harvey-Samuel et al. 2017; Grunwald et al. 2019) or damage economically important crops (Barrett et al. 2019). These elements can be autonomously propagating full-drives or act on more local scales as split drives in which a Cas9 source inherited in a Mendelian fashion drops out of the population (Gantz et al. 2015; Li et al. 2020; Terradas et al. 2021)., CRISPR-based drives exploit the Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNAs (gRNAs) to induce site-specific double-strand DNA breaks that either lead to desired drive-copying outcomes via homology-directed repair (HDR; Gantz and Bier 2015), or alternatively, to generation of cleavage-resistant mutant alleles via the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (Unckless et al. 2017). NHEJ alleles, typically generated at higher frequencies in zygotic stages prior to germline allocation where allelic conversion takes place in females, can impede spread of the gene-drive system if they do not carry a detrimental fitness cost to the organism. While several second-generation drives have overcome this hurdle by different molecular mechanisms (Marshall et al. 2017; Champer et al. 2018; Adolfi et al. 2020; Terradas et al. 2021), there is a pressing need to elucidate the relationship between Cas9 endonuclease expression/activity and drive performance to inform the design of future drive systems in diverse organisms. In particular, understanding mechanisms that determine the efficiency of copying vs generation of resistant alleles is essential for the success and safe deployment of gene-drive technologies., Two efficient gene drives have been developed for population modification, one targeting the major African malarial vector, Anopheles gambiae (Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020), and the second the Indo-Pakistani Asian vector, Anopheles stephensi (Adolfi et al. 2020). In laboratory cage trials, both systems drive rapidly to replace a reference nondrive population. While reproducibly achieving highly penetrant introduction of the drive element, even when seeded at low frequencies, the molecular mechanisms underlying their efficient performance differ. The AgNosCd-1 drive in A. gambiae (Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020), designated herein as cd:nos-Cas9, is inserted in the cardinal (cd) locus and expresses the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease under the control of nanos (nos) promoter sequences. cd:nos-Cas9 displays highly efficient drive when passed through both genders and generates few NHEJ alleles, resulting in the drive spreading into populations without significant accumulation of resistant alleles (Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020). The A. stephensi counterpart (Reckh; Adolfi et al. 2020); designated herein as reckh:vas-Cas9), inserted into the kynurenine hydroxylase (kh) locus, expresses Cas9 under the control of the vasa promoter and carries a recoded cDNA copy of the kh gene that restores endogenous gene function upon copying. This drive copies at extremely high frequencies when transmitted through males. However, in contrast to cd:nos-Cas9, reckh:vas-Cas9 generates a significant frequency of NHEJ-induced drive-resistant events when passed through females (Pham et al. 2019; Adolfi et al. 2020). These NHEJ alleles, which are mostly loss-of-function (kh–) alleles, survive in male offspring, but carry high viability and reproductive fitness costs in females (Pham et al. 2019) resulting in their rapid culling from the population by a dominantly acting process designated “lethal/sterile mosaicism” (Guichard et al. 2019; Adolfi et al. 2020). These distinct drive properties, particularly evident in females, suggest that relevant differences in promoter-driven Cas9 expression patterns might contribute to the differential performance of these drives during oogenesis. In anautogenous insects (and in the gene drive field), research of developmental genes has relied mostly on quantitative PCR or fusion proteins that act as reporters for their presence in the germline, but do not accurately provide an indication of their DNA/RNA subcellular localization, which is an essential feature for proper Cas9-mediated cleavage and repair. In this study, we modified an insect multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and paired it with high-resolution confocal microscopy to elucidate two primary questions important to the gene-drive field: (1) what is the optimal temporal and spatial expression of Cas9 to sustain HDR-mediated cassette copying while minimizing NHEJ outcomes in current CRISPR-based gene drives? and (2) do cis-regulatory promoter elements chosen to direct Cas9 expression faithfully recapitulate expression patterns of the endogenous germline gene (vasa or nos)? Another related question is whether there might be any potential species-specific differences in germline gene regulation that could underlie differential drive performance., We addressed these questions by comparing transcript distribution patterns of Cas9 transgenes driven by the vasa (A. stephensi) or nos (A. gambiae) promoters in the germline of transgenic individuals to those of the endogenous genes. We observe overall strong concordance between promoter-driven Cas9 and endogenous gene expression patterns for both drive systems in males, but also find differences in the female germline of A. gambiae. In addition, we survey expression patterns of selected candidate genes using these high-resolution methods whose control sequences might be considered for future applications., Anopheles stephensi and A. gambiae mosquito lines were obtained from the James’ lab at University of California, Irvine and maintained at Bier’s ACL-2 insectary under standard rearing conditions of 27°C at 77% humidity and a 12 h day/night lightning cycle. Larvae were reared in distilled water and were fed a diet of powdered TetraMin® fish food (Tetra, Germany). Adults were kept with 10% sucrose solution ad libitum. Blood meals were provided with defibrinated calf blood (Colorado Serum Co., CO, USA) and administered using a membrane-feeding system (Hemotek Ltd, UK). All handling protocols followed safety procedures approved by the University of California, San Diego., Probes used for the study were prepared by initially amplifying genomic A. stephensi and A. gambiae DNA and PCR products were cloned into pCR™II-TOPO™ vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). After successful transformation, selected bacterial colonies were isolated and plasmid templates sequenced. Haptenylated anti-sense mRNA probes were synthesized as described previously (Kosman et al. 2004) using the SP6 or T7 promoter, dissolved in 200 µl hybridization buffer, and stored at −20°C for later use. Probes were prepared for the following endogenous genes: β2-tubulin (1.5 kb, ASTE003208), vasa (1.9 kb, ASTE003241), nos (1 kb, AGAP006098), oskar (1.5 kb, ASTE003241), snail (1.8 kb, ASTE008611), spo11 (2 kb, ASTE08988), zpg (1.3 kb, ASTE011088). The same probe targeting Anopheles-optimized Cas9 was used in both species as it is a shared feature between cd:nos (Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020) and reckh:vas (Adolfi et al. 2020) transgenes. Primers used for the generation of probes can be found in Supplementary Table S1., Ovaries and testes of 4- to 5-day-old adult A. stephensi and A. gambiae mosquitoes were dissected into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution on ice. Tissue samples were fixed within 1 h of collection for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 3–4 washes for 5 min each in PBT (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) to completely remove the paraformaldehyde from the solution, samples were stored in methanol at −20°C. mRNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (Kosman et al. 2004) using the gene-specific probes shown above and presented in Supplementary Table S1. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary sheep anti-DIG (1:600, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 111333089001) and/or primary mouse anti-FITC (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 11426320001). The following day, after washing off the primary antibody, samples were incubated for 2 h at RT with secondary donkey anti-sheep antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:400, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A-11015) and/or donkey anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 555 (1:400, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A-31570). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen, CA, USA), which was added to the washing buffer at a 1:500 dilution. Ovaries and testes were mounted in ProLong™ Diamond Antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and imaged 3–10 days after mounting., The fluorescent testes and ovaries were imaged on a Leica TCS SP8X confocal microscope with white light laser and lighting super-resolution (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Either single slice or image stacks were taken. Images were deconvolved using the microscope’s built-in software (Leica Application Suite X)., Tissues were dissected, placed directly in RNAlater™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), and held for less than an hour on ice to minimize nucleic acid degradation. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and the concentration obtained by NanoDrop™ One (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Cycles of reverse transcription were performed to obtain cDNA using SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and diluted 1:50 before its use in subsequent qPCRs. Runs were performed using iQ™ SYBR® Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., CA, USA) on a MyiQ™ single color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., CA, USA). All qPCR (gene) values were normalized to the housekeeping A. stephensi or A. gambiae rpS7. Expression ratios were obtained using the ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001). qPCR primers can be found in Supplementary Table S1., Confocal images were processed using the Leica Application Suite X software and edited using Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 (Adobe Inc., CA, USA). All schemes and modifications of the qPCR graphs were produced using Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Adobe Inc., CA, USA). These, along with their statistics, were initially generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA)., As summarized earlier, the cd:nos-Cas9 drive is efficiently transmitted through both male and female germlines in A. gambiae (Carballar-Lejarazú et al. 2020), whereas the reckh:vas-Cas9 element only drove efficiently via males in A. stephensi (Gantz et al. 2015; Adolfi et al. 2020; Figure 1A). We examined the distribution of Cas9 expression in the germlines of these two transgenic mosquitoes to assess whether their differential efficiencies might be related to the fidelity of promoter-driven Cas9 expression or, alternatively, to differences in endogenous gene expression (e.g., vasa/nos) including possible species-specific differences in orthologous gene expression. We dissected male and female gonads (testes and ovaries, respectively) of transgenic A. gambiae and A. stephensi, hybridized them with antisense RNA probes to the products of the endogenous nos and vasa genes, and then examined multiplex gene-specific fluorescence patterns by confocal microscopy. Since the two transgenic lines evaluated here were developed in species that diverged ∼40 Mya (Figure 1B; Neafsey et al. 2015), we were not expecting to detect large-scale transcriptional differences or mRNA localization between the regulatory components of the well-conserved endogenous vasa and nos genes or the promoter elements used to express the Cas9 transgenes., Gene-drive transmission and NHEJ rates differ for A. stephensi and A. gambiae in a sex-dependent manner.

Due to the continuous production of sperm, all developmental stages of the male germline are present in a single adult testis, which we isolated from ∼5-day-old mosquitoes in this study, unless stated otherwise. In contrast, oogenesis in anautogenous mosquitoes follows a more regulated development pathway. Mosquito eggs begin to develop after emergence, whereupon they grow to a certain stage (previtellogenic) and then arrest until a blood meal is taken (Clements and Boocock 1984). Prior to and during the arrest phase, nurse cells containing polytene chromosomes (Zhimulev and Koryakov 2009) facilitate high levels of transcription for those genes needed for oocyte and early embryonic development (Royzman et al. 2002). Transcripts are delivered into the transcriptionally inactive oocyte via microfilament-based contracting ring canals (Gutzeit 1986; Dana et al. 2005). Intake of a blood meal acts as the trigger to reactivate the transcription machinery and to complete the final stages of egg development to achieve maturation (Figure 1C). During these later stages, nurse cells begin to undergo developmentally induced apoptosis (Foley and Cooley 1998) and their remaining contents are degraded or translocated into the oocyte (Royzman et al. 2002). In accordance with this conditional two-stage developmental program, we dissected ovaries at two different time points (∼5 days old—pre-blood meal, ∼8 days old—24 h postblood meal). This protocol permitted examination of gene expression and mRNA localization patterns both prior to and following transcriptional arrest, as well as potential shifts in RNA localization between different cellular compartments., We designed and synthesized RNA probes complementary to the endogenous vasa (A. stephensi) and nos (A. gambiae) genes and Cas9 transgene (identical probe for both species) and performed FISH using high-resolution confocal microscopy to examine cell-type specificity of mRNA expression as well as sub-cellular transcript localization patterns in male and female germline tissues. We first compared accumulation of the endogenous vasa locus and the vasa-driven Cas9 transgene in the A. stephensi reckh:vas-Cas9-drive strain. We were able to detect abundant transcripts of both genes in ovaries pre- and post-bloodfeeding, as well as in the testes (Figure 2). Pre-blood meal ovaries displayed a high degree of overlap between accumulation of the endogenous vasa gene and vasa-driven Cas9 transgene transcripts surrounding the oocyte (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1). These concordant transcript patterns validate the identification of vasa promoter sequences that drive normal expression of the Cas9 transgene. In the ovary, both the Cas9 and vasa genes were transcribed initially in nurse cells (see independent green and magenta transcriptional dots in each nurse cell) and shortly thereafter these transcripts became localized to, and concentrated around, the oocyte. At this stage, we could distinguish the seven nurse cells from the single oocyte-fated cell based on the intensity of DAPI staining as a consequence of nurse cells being polyploid vs the diploid content of the oocyte nucleus, the chromosomal contents of the latter being barely detectable using our standard microscope settings (Figure 2, Supplementary Video S1). Following a blood meal, the oocyte starts growing, its nucleus doubles in size (Fiil 1974) and a shift in RNA localization occurs. While high levels of transcripts remained present in nurse cells, no further RNA import into the oocyte appeared evident. Thus, we observed strong mRNA accumulation throughout cytoplasmic regions surrounding the nurse cells (Figure 2). In the testes, there was also a tight correlation between the patterns of endogenous and Cas9 transcript localization (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1). Both vasa and Cas9 transcripts were present only in proximal areas of the testes distant from the vas eferens., Endogenous vasa and Cas9 transgene expression and transcript localization in the germline of A. stephensi reckh:vas-Cas9 mosquitoes. Columns (left to right) depict pre or post-blood meal ovaries and testes. Rows (top to bottom) show the RNA presence of vasa (green), vasa-driven Cas9 (magenta) and their overlap (pearl). RNA localization for both genes correlates well in ovaries, especially translocating around the oocyte pre-blood meal. In testes, vasa and Cas9 RNA are seen early in development, specifically in premeiosis and germline stem cells., Endogenous vasa and Cas9 transgene expression and transcript localization in the germline of A. stephensi reckh:vas-Cas9 mosquitoes. Columns (left to right) depict pre or post-blood meal ovaries and testes. Rows (top to bottom) show the RNA presence of vasa (green), vasa-driven Cas9 (magenta) and their overlap (pearl). RNA localization for both genes correlates well in ovaries, especially translocating around the oocyte pre-blood meal. In testes, vasa and Cas9 RNA are seen early in development, specifically in premeiosis and germline stem cells., The spatial patterns of nos-Cas9 transcripts in the germline of nonbloodfed cd:nos-Cas9 A. gambiae females paralleled that of the endogenous nos locus on a gross cellular level (e.g., confined to nurse cells and the oocyte), but did not overlap on a subcellular scale (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S2). This divergence in transcript localization was particularly evident throughout the cytoplasm surrounding the outer portion of the follicle, where Cas9 transcripts accumulated in the absence of a corresponding nos signal (Figure 3—magenta only, Supplementary Video S2). We also examined transcript localization patterns in the A. gambiae female germline following a blood meal. While post-bloodfed A. stephensi ovarian samples revealed coincident accumulation of vasa-Cas9 and endogenous vasa transcripts (Figure 2), patterns of nos-cas9 and endogenous nos in A. gambiae transcripts displayed a notable difference. Endogenous nos transcripts were observed in nurse cells but also in the oocyte at lower levels, while Cas9 transcripts were restricted only to nurse cells. We also tested for differences between nos endogenous and nos-driven Cas9 transcripts by qPCR (Supplementary Figure S3). Relative to A. gambiae rpS7, Cas9 transcript abundance was several fold lower than for nos, suggesting that the promoter used to drive Cas9 in the transgenic mosquito does not fully recapitulate endogenous nos expression levels or that, alternatively, nos mRNA transcripts are more stable than their Cas9 counterparts. Differences in Cas9 mRNA production (and drive capacity) between species aligns with the thought that the generation of excessive amounts of Cas9 protein is detrimental to gene-drive efficiency. Results in A. gambiae transgenic mosquito testes paralleled those obtained in A. stephensi, where we observed coincident localization and accumulation of the nos-Cas9 transgene and endogenous nos transcripts (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S2). Both genes were localized primarily in regions corresponding to premeiotic and meiotic cells. These highly concordant accumulation patterns in the male germline in both A. stephensi and A. gambiae are consistent with the high efficiency of allelic conversion observed in males for both drives, which achieve ∼99% efficiency in both species., Endogenous nos and Cas9 transgene expression and transcript localization in the germline of A. gambiae cd:nos-Cas9 mosquitoes. Columns (left to right) depict pre and post-blood meal ovaries or testes. Rows (top to bottom) show the RNA presence of endogenous nos (green), nos-driven Cas9 (magenta) or the overlap (pearl). RNA in pre-blood meal ovaries correlates on the outer regions of the follicle, but only Cas9 is seen in the mid-section. Similarly, we observe differences post-blood meal with only nos being detectable in the developed oocyte. In testes, both genes are detected very early in development (Stem cell niche) but also slightly in cells undergoing meiosis., Endogenous nos and Cas9 transgene expression and transcript localization in the germline of A. gambiae cd:nos-Cas9 mosquitoes. Columns (left to right) depict pre and post-blood meal ovaries or testes. Rows (top to bottom) show the RNA presence of endogenous nos (green), nos-driven Cas9 (magenta) or the overlap (pearl).

Similarly, we observe differences post-blood meal with only nos being detectable in the developed oocyte. In testes, both genes are detected very early in development (Stem cell niche) but also slightly in cells undergoing meiosis., In addition to assessing germline promoters used for the A. stephensi and A. gambiae gene drives, we also employed our in situ hybridization method to examine transcript accumulation profiles of other germline candidate genes known to play essential roles in the germline development through genetic studies. These genes include those whose promoters have been used in efficient gene drives such as zero population growth (zpg; Tazuke et al. 2002), which sustains excellent drive in A. gambiae (Kyrou et al. 2018)) and candidate genes known to play key roles in germline development. Germline developmental genes included oskar (Ephrussi et al. 1991; Kim-Ha et al. 1991), the transcription factor snail (Nieto 2002), and spo11 (McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara 1998), a key conserved component of the meiotic recombination machinery. We examined endogenous transcript accumulation profiles for each of these genes in both male and female reproductive tissues of A. stephensi to evaluate whether their promoters might be of potential future interest for driving germline-restricted expression of Cas9. We used the previously described A. stephensi male-specific β2-tubulin gene (Yamamoto et al. 2019), expressed in meiotic cells of the testes, as a control of late meiotic expression and technique (Figure 4). We first confirmed that β2-tubulin transcription is indeed male-specific using quantitative gene amplification (qPCR; Supplementary Figure S3). In situ hybridization corroborated that the gene is highly expressed, as expected, in late stages of spermatogenesis in the testes (note that we also detected what we believe to be nonspecific cross-hybridization of this ß2-tubulin probe in female egg chambers with another tubulin homolog due to partial sequence overlap in a portion of the cDNA used to synthesize the probe—see legend of Figure 4 for details)., Transcription and transcript localization patterns of candidate germline genes.

Columns depict detection of mRNAs in ovaries pre-blood meal (5 days old), ovaries 24 h post-blood meal (8 days old), and testes (5 days old). Note: we observed cross-hybridization signals in female gonads with a similar β-tubulin (ASTE000064), which is expressed in both genders and shares 81% nucleotide homology to our initial target sequence, hence the detection shown in pre-bloodfeeding samples (post- was not surveyed after observing the cross-reactivity of the probe). Expression seen in testes is most likely a combination of male-specific β2-tubulin (ASTE003208) and ASTE000064., Transcription and transcript localization patterns of candidate germline genes.

Expression seen in testes is most likely a combination of male-specific β2-tubulin (ASTE003208) and ASTE000064., In the case of the zpg gene, transcripts were found to localize to the oocyte in pre-blood meal samples, albeit at significantly lower levels than in the testes and in contrast to the more comparable transcript levels of vasa or nos present in both male and female germlines (Figure 4). In males, zpg expression was observed through premeiotic and meiotic stages of development in patterns that are reminiscent of the vasa and nos genes while also generating a strong signal in the sperm flagella and vas eferens, in contrast to the other genes examined. Transcripts of developmental genes, such as oskar or snail, were localized in specific germline patterns that may render their regulatory sequences suitable for driving cas9 expression, as well (Kim-Ha et al. 1991; Kosman et al. 1991). In our studies, transcripts of both genes accumulated primarily in premeiotic regions of A. stephensi testes (Figure 4) similar to what we and others have observed for vasa (Papathanos et al. 2009) and nos (Calvo et al. 2005) promoter-driven Cas9 transgenes. These genes accumulated in distinct patterns in the female germline. For example, snail transcripts were spread throughout the follicle (Figure 4), reminiscent of Cas9 transcripts driven by the nos promoter in cd:nos-Cas9 (Figure 1D). The notable shared localization and accumulation patterns of nos-Cas9 and snail in the female germline suggest that snail also may sustain efficient female drive. In contrast, oskar accumulation mirrors its iconic pattern in the oocyte’s posterior pole (Figure 4), as previously reported both in fruit flies (Kim-Ha et al. 1991) and A. gambiae (Juhn et al. 2008). In the case of spo11, we did not observe any gonad-specific transcript localization in ovaries of nonblood fed female mosquitoes (Figure 4). Consistent with spo11 expression being very low or absent in nonblood fed females, virtually no expression was detected by qPCR in ovaries dissected from these mosquitoes (Supplementary Figure S3). However, spo11 transcripts were readily observed following blood feeding in nurse cells and rapidly transported into the oocyte (Figure 4). In the testes, spo11 transcripts were comparatively more abundant (Papa et al. 2017; Supplementary Figure S3) and were localized in the same general spatial meiotic zone as other germline genes. These transcripts, however, appeared to be excluded from the stem cell niche at the tip of the testes that contains the germline stem cells (Figure 4)., As mentioned above, we noted striking differences in overall transcript abundance between A. stephensi and A. gambiae by qPCR. Transcripts of the former were consistently found to be at much higher levels than the latter. We examined whether these unexpected quantitative amplification differences in transcript levels were also reflected in FISH by applying the same exact confocal settings in stains for Cas9 using the same probe in both reckh:vas-Cas9 and cd:nos-Cas9. Although FISH is not a quantitative assay due to variations that arise among samples, probe length, binding efficiency and fluorescence, the identical Cas9 probe was used for hybridization of tissue from both transgenic lines, which should detect transcripts with similar efficiency in both species. Consistent with the qPCR results, we detected much stronger signals of both vasa and corresponding Cas9 in A. stephensi compared to nos and Cas9 in A. gambiae (Supplementary Figure S4). This was further supported when we compared two stains for oskar using the same scanning parameters. In this case, probes were",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different and hence the detection could be due to differences in probe synthesis, however, the interspecies variation was very pronounced between the two (Supplementary Figure S5)., This study focused on the use of a high-resolution in situ visualization method to compare transcriptional features of two of the most-promising population modification gene-drive systems developed to date, one specific for the Asian malarial vector A. stephensi and one for its African counterpart, A. gambiae. Despite both systems being able to achieve full introduction into naïve mosquito populations, they do so based on distinct mechanisms. In particular, the kh:vas-Cas9 drive (A. stephensi) is copied less efficiently when transmitted via females as a result of maternally inherited Cas9/gRNA complexes generating significant rates of NHEJ alleles. The great majority of these NHEJ alleles are loss-of-function mutations that carry severe fitness costs leading to their rapid loss from the population through the transient dominantly acting process of lethal mosaicism (Guichard et al. 2019; Adolfi et al. 2020; Terradas et al. 2021). In contrast, the cd:nos-Cas9 (A. gambiae) transgene displays a highly efficient drive through both sexes, rarely generating NHEJ alleles in either gender. These differences in performance between drives motivated us to examine them at a cellular level to pinpoint where, when, and how much, Cas9 must be expressed in order to support efficient drive performance., In the case of the kh:vas-Cas9 drive, we observed a good correlation in the localization of endogenous vasa and Cas9 transgene transcripts in both pre- and post-blood meal ovaries. During the arrest phase, transcripts localized around the oocyte, consistent with the general process by which nurse cells typically transcribe mRNAs and then transport them into the much less-transcriptionally active oocyte. However, 24 h after resuming transcription (triggered by the blood intake), we observed that both vasa and Cas9 were present mainly around the decaying nurse cells presumably due to the difficulty in moving any transcripts into the oocyte at this stage. In ovaries, similar patterns of endogenous vasa distribution were reported in previous studies (Papathanos et al. 2009), as well as when using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a fusion reporter. As observed when surveying for alternative promoters, the vasa mRNA localization profile is recapitulated for many genes that are transcriptionally induced, or active, following the intake of a blood meal. In the testes, we observed localization of both vasa and Cas9 transcripts in regions furthest from the vas eferens. These zones correspond to stem cell and premeiotic phases of development. This interpretation of vasa early meiotic-specific expression is supported further by the lack of transcripts in intervening regions, where a ring of mitotically dividing stem cells resides (Supplementary Figure S1) and where the lack of expression in these supporting stem cells was also observed in a previous study using vasa-driven eGFP (Papathanos et al. 2009)., Paralleling our findings with the kh:vas-Cas9 drive, we similarly detected almost perfect correlation of endogenous nos and Cas9 transcripts in cd:nos-Cas9 transgenic testes. However, we observed discordant transcript localization in ovaries. These divergent patterns are consistent with the possibility that the cis-acting elements driving Cas9 expression lack subcellular mRNA localization sequences present in the endogenous nos transcripts. The most detailed analysis of nos functionality and gene architecture has been performed in Drosophila, where 3′UTR termination sequences play an essential role for localization and translational repression of gene transcripts (Gavis et al. 1996a, 1996b). One hypothesis for why the nos 3′UTR used to direct expression and localization of the Cas9 transgene did not recapitulate the endogenous pattern is that the transgene transcripts may lack required sequences for proper localization. The A. gambiae endogenous nos 5′UTR contains an intron close to the ATG translation initiation site that is not present in the cd:nos-Cas9 drive (or in other queried mosquito species), which could regulate its mRNA localization directly or interacting with its own 3′UTR similar to what occurs in Drosophila (Gavis et al. 1996a, 1996b). In support of this hypothesis, initial attempts to recapitulate vasa expression without introns achieved only single sex expression (Papathanos et al. 2009), but later proved as an excellent promoter for Cas9 expression when including them., When comparing the design of A. gambiae transgenes reported in other studies (Hammond et al. 2021), the 5′UTR used as a promoter for Cas9 expression included this intron (Figure 1D, red box). This genome-comparable version of nos-Cas9, containing a full 5′UTR sequence, performed less efficiently in females than the cd:nos-Cas9 transgenic line analyzed in this study. While we hypothesize that the presence vs. absence of the intron may explain part of the divergence between the two assayed nos promoters, it is likely that the genomic insertion locus and gRNA target site also play a role in determining copying rates and selection for fitness. In prior experiments, the aforementioned intron was part of the construct, as well as multiple deviations from the consensus sequence that reflect natural sequence variation among mosquito populations. Perhaps, the inclusion of this small intronic fragment restricts expression of the gene in such a fashion as to limit Cas9-mediated drive efficacy, while its exclusion may lead to the imperfect overlap with the native transcript pattern. While we observed these significant differences in transcript localization, we note that nos transcripts are translationally repressed when not properly localized (Gavis et al. 1996b), and thus that the impact of improper localization of Cas9 may be reduced. Despite the imperfect overlap of transgene vs. endogenous transcript patterns, the transgenic cd:nos-Cas9 mosquito displays excellent drive performance. Whether this anomalous component of Cas9 localization influences the ability of the endonuclease to increase the frequencies of allelic conversion or, alternatively, the choice of gRNA is responsible for the high-fidelity drive remains to be determined in future experiments. In post-blood meal ovaries, endogenous nos transcripts localized into the oocyte, but Cas9 did not. One potential explanation for these divergent distributions is that the latter (Cas9) is excluded from the oocyte due to failure of being transported through nuclear import channels (Figure 3). This difference in post-blood meal transcript distribution may again reflect exclusion of specific nos upstream elements or missing terminal 3′ sequences in the cd:nos-Cas9 construct, but it is potentially beneficial to the drive as lack of Cas9 transcripts in the oocyte may minimize the formation NHEJ alleles as a consequence of maternal carryover to the zygote., Complementing our analysis of the two efficient gene drives, we employed our high-resolution in situ detection methods to examine expression patterns of candidate genes whose germline-specific cis-regulatory sequences might be of potential use as efficient drivers for Cas9 in A. stephensi. Among these genes, zpg (its promoter already having been shown to be highly effective in A. Gambiae; Hammond et al. 2021) displays a pattern similar to that of vasa, yet at lower levels, at least in the female germline. Reduced Cas9 levels have been shown to minimize off-target and toxicity effects of the endonuclease in Drosophila (Champer et al. 2017), which may be relevant to the excellent performance of zpg observed in A. gambiae drive studies (Kyrou et al. 2018; Hammond et al. 2021). In contrast to expression in female reproductive tissues, the strong zpg mRNA signal detected in the sperm flagella could pose difficulties for a drive construct via the parental deposition of Cas9 into the zygote. However, previous studies did not observe this potential carryover to cause such problems (Kyrou et al. 2018). Another gene with a sharply delimited expression pattern is oskar, with transcripts localizing to the oocyte pole in nonblood fed ovaries. Given its tight transcript localization in the oocyte where germ cells form, oskar might prove effective in restricting Cas9 activity to meiotic components of the germline in both genders, mirroring the developmental timing in testes to premeiotic stem cells. We also observed tight meiotic localization of spo11, which in mammals has been used to control Cas9 expression, resulting in drive through both males (Weitzel et al. 2021) and females (Grunwald et al. 2019). In mosquitoes, spo11 transcripts are not present prior to or during the arrest phase, but express and accumulate in the oocyte following a blood meal when transcription restarts. This observation suggests that spo11 is either absent in early stages or that its transcripts fall below the limit of detection, possibly reflecting only very few molecules being needed to initiate recombination events during meiosis, consistent with this transcript being barely detectable in ovaries (Papa et al. 2017; Supplementary Figure S3). Such low expression of Cas9 should lead to minimal chromosomal damage and thus spo11 cis-regulatory elements may be of interest to explore in subsequent iterations of insect gene drive technologies. Strong expression of spo11 after bloodfeeding, however, may lead to maternal deposition in the zygote and cause detrimental NHEJ events. We also noted that we detected significant difference in overall detected transcript abundance between A. gambiae and A. stephensi. Future experiments may shed light on these striking differences in apparent transcript levels, which could reflect some physical differences between the two species that limit the fraction of extractable and/or hybridizable mRNAs in A. gambiae relative to A. stephensi. Alternatively, alterations in developmental timing may exist between these fairly closely related species, which might account for some of these differences. Females were dissected at 5 days old and, while the follicle sizes were similar between the two species, transcription (or arrest) of certain genes may start later in A. gambiae than A. stephensi and thus transcripts may not be as readily detected/extracted during these stages in the former., In summary, this study provides a novel high-resolution comparative assessment of endogenous vs Cas9 transgene mRNA accumulation and localization in two mosquito strains carrying high-performance gene-drive systems. Differences detected by high-resolution RNA in situ techniques in these two transgenic mosquito lines suggest that promoter-dependent Cas9 transcript localization may play a critical role in female drive outcomes. No appreciable disparities were detected between endogenous and Cas9 transgene RNA accumulation or localization in the testes, where transcripts were restricted to the stem cell niche and premeiotic cells for both vasa-Cas9 and nos-Cas9 systems. These initial steps toward understanding the basis for differing drive properties are important not only for elucidating Cas9-mediated cellular mechanisms but also for gene-drive developers to evaluate and predict the performance of promoters that may be used in future studies in these and other insects of potential interest., Supplementary Figures S1–S6 as well as primers (Supplementary Table S1) and reagents (Supplementary Table S2) used to generate the RNA probes or perform the in situ hybridization experiments can be found in the main Supplementary File.

We hypothesize that this is an indirect effect driven by the loss of microRNA binding sites within the MtnA 3′ untranslated region., Adaptation of a species to changes in environmental conditions caused by seasonal variation, climate change, or range expansion is necessary for survival and proliferation. Understanding the process of such adaptation is an intrinsic goal of evolutionary biologists, however, a major challenge is the identification of adaptive traits and their underlying molecular and genetic bases. Drosophila melanogaster, due to its experimental versatility, well-detailed genetics, and broad geographic distribution, has become a leading model organism for studying the molecular basis of adaptation and environment-based selection. Previous work on this topic typically has involved genomic comparisons between D. melanogaster populations from the ancestral (sub-Saharan Africa) and derived (cosmopolitan) species ranges (Harr et al. 2002; Ometto et al. 2005; Hutter et al. 2008; Glaser-Schmitt and Parsch 2018; Voigt et al. 2019), and may include an environmental gradient such as a latitudinal cline (Sezgin et al. 2004; Bergland et al. 2016; Juneja et al. 2016; Cogni et al. 2017; Erickson et al. 2020)., One example of a clinally varying genetic polymorphism is a 49-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the Metallothionein A (MtnA) gene (Catalán et al. 2016). The deletion represents the derived allele: it is rare in sub-Saharan African populations and absent in closely related Drosophila species (Lange et al. 1990; Theodore et al. 1991; Stephan et al. 1994). In non-African populations, the deletion is common and increases in frequency with distance from the equator in Europe, North America, and Australia (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). Functionally, the deletion is associated with increased MtnA expression and greater oxidative stress tolerance (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). These observations suggest that the MtnA deletion is selectively favored, at least in temperate regions, due to a beneficial effect of providing protection against oxidative stress. Another cosmopolitan polymorphism, Bari-Juvenile hormone epoxy hydrolase (Bari-Jheh), which is a transposable element insertion associated with changes in the regulation of the Juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (Jheh) genes and increased oxidative stress tolerance (González et al. 2009; Guio et al. 2014), is also present at high frequency in temperate populations. In Drosophila species, temperate populations have been shown to be more cold tolerant than ancestral, tropical populations (Svetec et al. 2011; von Heckel et al. 2016; Königer and Grath 2018). Given that both the MtnA deletion and Bari-Jheh insertion are more common in regions that experience cold temperatures and large seasonal fluctuations in temperature, it is possible that thermal variability contributes directly to oxidative stress (Joanisse and Storey 1996, 1998; Harrison et al. 2001; Klok et al. 2004; Lalouette et al. 2011; MacMillan et al. 2012), and/or that these two forms of stress induce a common response pathway., In this study, we examine oxidative stress tolerance and the transcriptional response to oxidative stress in inbred lines derived from cosmopolitan (Germany, Cyprus, and Malaysia) and sub-Saharan African (Zambia) populations of D. melanogaster. For the cosmopolitan populations, we compare paired samples that differ in the presence of the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion, including nearly isogenic lines from Germany and Cyprus in which the remainder of the genome has been homogenized. We find that the MtnA deletion is associated with increased oxidative stress tolerance in the German background, but not the Cypriot or Malaysian background, which highlights the importance of genetic background on the physiological effects of the MtnA deletion. We detected a strong transcriptional response to oxidative stress in all lines, including the up-regulation of MtnA expression, which is consistent with it playing a protective role against oxidative stress. There was significant overlap between the genes up-regulated during oxidative stress and those up-regulated by cold stress, although there were also many genes that responded specifically to one type of stress or the other. Across all backgrounds the presence of the MtnA deletion led to a greater transcriptional response to oxidative stress, which may be caused by the loss of microRNA (miRNA) binding sites within the deleted region of the 3′ UTR, increasing the availability of the miRNAs to regulate other genes., Isofemale lines from Munich, Germany (M9 and M12) and Nicosia, Cyprus (C2) were established from wild-caught flies collected in 2014 (Kapun et al. 2020). Each line was derived from a single female and maintained by mass sib–sib mating at each generation (in vials with approximately 50–100 flies transferred per generation). After the initial establishment of the isofemale lines, the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion was found to segregate within these lines, as determined by PCR-genotyping of individual flies (Catalán et al. 2016). These lines were maintained in the same way for an additional 50–60 generations. Subsequently, individual males and females within each isofemale line were mated to generate new inbred lines homozygous for either the deletion or the nondeletion allele. The deletion status of each new inbred line was verified by genotyping both parents, as well as a pool of 10 of their offspring. We additionally examined two isofemale lines from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which had previously been shown to differ in their MtnA 3′ UTR allele (KL1, deletion; KL2, nondeletion) (Catalán et al. 2016), and four isofemale lines from the ancestral range of the species in Siavonga, Zambia (ZI197, ZI254, ZI273, and ZI418) (Pool et al. 2012). All of the Zambian lines had the ancestral, nondeletion MtnA allele (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). In the following, lines with the MtnA deletion are indicated with a “Δ” at the end of their line name. All stocks were maintained on cornmeal-yeast-molasses medium at 21°C and a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle., Previously, using Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP) lines (Mackay et al. 2012) we detected a significant association between the MtnA deletion and increased tolerance to menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)-induced stress (Ramnarine et al. 2019). Therefore, to determine the effects of genetic background and the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion on oxidative stress tolerance, we assayed the survivorship of adult flies of each line after exposure to MSB (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). For each line, males (age 4–6 days) were separated from culture and sorted into replicate groups of 20 flies per vial on standard food (cornmeal-yeast-molasses medium) for 1 day to acclimate. On the following day, 3–5 replicates from each line were transferred to “control” vials containing standard fly food and 5–16 replicates from each line were transferred to “stress” vials containing 75 mM MSB-dosed cornmeal-yeast-molasses medium. Assays were performed in tolerance chambers at 25°C with a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. Mortality was recorded as the proportion of dead flies in the stress treatment compared to the control after 48 h., To measure the transcriptional response to oxidative stress, we repeated the MSB stress tolerance assays described above. The German, Malaysian, and Cypriot lines were exposed to stress (or control) condition for 24 h and then total RNA was extracted from two biological replicates per line. Each replicate used 60 whole heads from living male flies. The Zambian flies under both treatments were exposed for a shorter time (18–20 h) to compensate for their high mortality and total RNA was extracted from heads in two replicates per line as described above. This design resulted in a total of 48 samples (12 lines × 2 treatments × 2 biological replicates) that were used for transcriptome profiling. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Poly-A mRNA purification, reverse transcription, and high-throughput sequencing were performed by Novogene (Cambridge, UK) using a Novaseq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. From the RNA-sequencing we obtained between 29.3 and 67.6 million reads per library, and an average of 97% of these reads were successfully mapped to the D. melanogaster transcriptome (FlyBase, release 6.31) (Thurmond et al. 2019) using NextGenMap (version 0.5.5) (Sedlazeck et al. 2013). The resulting alignments were used to estimate pairwise sequence divergence between strains, considering only sites with a minimum coverage of 20x in both strains., Differentially expressed genes were called with DESeq2 (version 1.28.1) (Love et al. 2014) as implemented in R (version 4.0.0) (R Core Team 2020). Significant differences between control and stress samples were determined using a Wald test and the P-values subsequently corrected for multiple testing according to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Genes with an adjusted P-value less than 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. Initially we performed unsupervised clustering (DESeq2 design: “∼population + genotype + treatment”) on the variance-stabilized data and visualized the results with a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed an extreme outlier, which was one of the Munich (M9) nondeletion stress replicates (Supplementary Figure S1). This sample was excluded from further analyses. To identify genes that shared a common change in expression after MSB exposure across all genetic backgrounds, we focused on the treatment factor and applied a design using only “∼treatment.” Lists of overall up- and downregulated differentially expressed genes associated to treatment (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were then generated for subsequent gene ontology (GO) analysis. These lists were also used in comparisons with two external transcriptomic datasets involving cold stress (von Heckel et al. 2016) and oxidative stress (Weber et al. 2012). For this, the log2 fold-change values of the genes matching the list of genes associated to oxidative stress (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3) and cold tolerance (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5) were compared. The significance of the overlap between the oxidative stress response and the cold response genes was determined by a hypergeometric test., GO analysis was performed using FlyMine (Lyne et al. 2007) to determine the number of significantly up-regulated and downregulated genes matching a GO term, and REVIGO (Supek et al. 2011) to merge redundant GO terms. A Holm–Bonferroni correction was applied to calculate adjusted P-values (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Information from FlyBase (release FB2019_06) (Thurmond et al. 2019) and AMIGO (Carbon et al. 2009) was used to cross-reference genes matching significant GO terms with their annotated function., To construct gene networks and identify highly relevant (hub) genes and pathways involved in the response to oxidative stress, we applied weighted gene coexpression analysis (WGCNA) (Zhang and Horvath 2005) as implemented in the R package “WGCNA” (version 1.69) using R (version 3.6.3) (Langfelder and Horvath 2008). The WGCNA approach allows for the detection of expression modules or pathways in which many genes show small but consistent changes and, therefore, complements the analysis of individual genes (GO analysis) by means of gene enrichment analysis. In the WGCNA workflow, normalized expression data are used to cluster genes that show similar expression across samples, indicating that the expression of the clustered genes is correlated. Such genes are referred to as being topologically correlated. Coexpression modules are defined by hierarchical clustering of these topological clusters modules. By convention, each module is assigned a color and genes that do not show any coexpression with other genes are placed in the “gray” module. After module identification, the module expression (eigengene) is used to associate the module with categorical information. We performed WGCNA with two design formulas for differential gene expression analysis: (1) considering only the effect of treatment (∼treatment) to build on the identified genes and pathways identified in the GO analysis, and (2) incorporating the effect of the MtnA indel (∼genotype + treatment + genotype: treatment) to identify differentially expressed genes in response to oxidative stress associated to the deletion background relative to the nondeletion background., To determine how the indel polymorphism in the MtnA 3′ UTR influenced gene expression and the response to oxidative stress, we applied the DESeq2 “∼treatment” design (described above) within each cosmopolitan background separately and then performed the following pairwise comparisons: deletion stress vs deletion control, nondeletion stress vs nondeletion control, deletion stress vs nondeletion stress and deletion control vs nondeletion control (Supplementary Table S6). Adjusted P-values were determined as described above, and genes with an adjusted P < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed between deletion and nondeletion lines within each treatment. This approach was particularly suited to the comparison of the nearly isogenic lines (Germany and Cyprus) and paired population samples (Malaysia), as it allowed for the comparison of MtnA genotypes without the extensive background variation present in between-strain or between-population comparisons., To determine if some of the expression differences observed between MtnA deletion and nondeletion lines could be caused by the differential binding of miRNAs, we examined the expression of conserved target genes associated with miRNAs predicted to bind within the 49-bp region that is deleted in MtnA 3′ UTR (Catalán et al. 2016). The target genes of these miRNAs were identified using TargetScanFly (version 7.2) (Agarwal et al. 2018). Because miRNAs are typically involved in the negative regulation of gene expression, we focused on the predicted target genes that were downregulated under oxidative stress. We then examined the expression of these genes using a direct contrast in DESeq2 (version 1.28.1) (Love et al. 2014) between deletion and nondeletion lines in the cosmopolitan backgrounds in response to stress (the Zambian lines were excluded because they were fixed for the nondeletion allele). A paired sample Wilcoxon test was applied to test for a directional disparity in the expression of these genes between deletion and nondeletion lines. Finally, the resulting list of genes was tested for functional enrichments using FlyMine (Lyne et al. 2007)., To assay oxidative stress tolerance of the different genotypes and populations, adult males (4–6 days post-eclosion) were placed on food containing 75 mM MSB and their mortality recorded over 48 h. As a control, males of the same age were placed on standard food. Since we observed no mortality on the standard food, we assume that any mortality observed on the MSB food is a consequence of MSB-induced oxidative stress and not any other aspect of the rearing conditions. A comparison of nearly isogenic lines differing specifically at the MtnA locus found that the 3′ UTR deletion was associated with increased oxidative stress tolerance in the German background, but not in the Cypriot background (Figure 1). When comparing the two isofemale lines from Malaysia, the MtnA deletion was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress tolerance. Thus, the effect of the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion on oxidative stress tolerance appears to be highly dependent on the genomic background and is variable among cosmopolitan populations. The Zambian lines, all of which had the ancestral (nondeletion) MtnA allele, were relatively susceptible to oxidative stress. However, there were differences in mortality among the Zambian lines, which suggests that genetic variation for oxidative stress tolerance is also segregating within the ancestral range of the species., Mortality after 48 h of exposure to MSB-dosed food in lines originating from: Munich, Germany (M9 and M12); Nicosia, Cyprus (C2); Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), and Siavonga, Zambia (ZI). Differences between MtnA genotypes within the same background were tested with a Wilcoxon test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001., Mortality after 48 h of exposure to MSB-dosed food in lines originating from: Munich, Germany (M9 and M12); Nicosia, Cyprus (C2); Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), and Siavonga, Zambia (ZI). Differences between MtnA genotypes within the same background were tested with a Wilcoxon test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001., To investigate the transcriptional response to oxidative stress, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the heads of male flies exposed to MSB-dosed and standard food. Across all samples, we found a strong transcriptional response to MSB treatment, with 45% of all expressed genes being differentially expressed in response to oxidative stress (false discovery rate = 5%). In total, 3434 (25%) genes were up-regulated after stress treatment (Supplementary Table S1), while 2839 (20%) were downregulated (Supplementary Table S2). A PCA showed that the majority of the variance (53%) could be explained by the treatment (PC1) (Figure 2), while the second principal component (PC2) mainly separates the samples by population and accounts for only 8% of the variance., PCA plot showing the amount of variation explained by treatment and population of origin: Munich, Germany (M9 and M12); Nicosia, Cyprus (C2); Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), and Siavonga, Zambia (ZI). Filled symbols represent the MSB-stress samples, while open symbols represent the control samples., PCA plot showing the amount of variation explained by treatment and population of origin: Munich, Germany (M9 and M12); Nicosia, Cyprus (C2); Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), and Siavonga, Zambia (ZI). Filled symbols represent the MSB-stress samples, while open symbols represent the control samples., A GO enrichment analysis of the genes showing a general up- or downregulation of expression in stressed samples relative to the controls revealed various processes broadly related to metabolism and stress response (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), with the strongest enrichments (ranked by P-value) being for categories related to metabolic processes (Table 1). In addition, we observed a large number of genes in the categories “proteolysis” (up-regulated; P = 2.51E-05) and “animal organ development” (downregulated; P = 3.23E-11)., Top five GO enrichment terms for genes up- or downregulated under oxidative stress, A Holm–Bonferroni correction was applied to the P-values., Top five GO enrichment terms for genes up- or downregulated under oxidative stress, A Holm–Bonferroni correction was applied to the P-values., In a previous quantitative trait locus study, seven genes (fog, nACRα-30D, ena, rg, CG9650, Eip75B, and hbn) that were significantly associated with oxidative stress susceptibility were functionally validated by comparing wild-type and mutant alleles (Weber et al. 2012). Of these seven genes, only one was significantly differentially expressed in our dataset (Eip75B), and it shows a relatively small difference in expression between treatments (log2 fold-change = 0.27; Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, there is little evidence that these genes play a role in the oxidative stress response of our samples, at least at the transcriptional level. We further examined the expression of genes associated to epoxide hydrolase, specifically the Jheh genes. The Bari-Jheh transposon, which is present at high frequencies in temperate regions, has been shown to have a cis-regulatory effect on the expression of nearby genes, leading to up-regulation of Jheh1 and Jheh2 and downregulation of Jheh3 under oxidative stress conditions (Guio et al. 2014). In our dataset, we observe the same relationship among these three genes in response to MSB (Supplementary Figure S3), which further supports their functional role in mediating oxidative stress tolerance., Previous studies suggested that there may be a common response to both cold and oxidative stress (Lalouette et al. 2011; MacMillan et al. 2016). To investigate this possibility, we compared the genes responding to oxidative stress in our study to those responding to cold stress in a previous study that compared the transcriptional response of European and African strains of D. melanogaster (von Heckel et al. 2016). For this, we focused on a time point of 90 min post-recovery after a 7-h cold shock, which shows the strongest response in terms of gene expression (Colinet et al. 2010; von Heckel et al. 2016). At this time point, 1535 genes were up-regulated and 1979 genes were downregulated in response to cold shock (von Heckel et al. 2016). Of these genes, a significant proportion overlaps with the differentially expressed genes induced by MSB as determined by a hypergeometric test, including 881 up-regulated (P = 1.4E-187) and 832 shared downregulated (P = 1.7E-126) genes. The study of von Heckel et al. (2016) identified 16 genes that respond to cold shock in a population-specific way (Europe vs Africa), indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction. In our data, 11 of these 16 genes showed a significant change in expression under oxidative stress (Supplementary Figure S4). Furthermore, of the 47 cold tolerance candidate genes identified by von Heckel et al. (2016), 34 are significantly differentially expressed under oxidative stress in our dataset (Supplementary Figure S5)., Modules of coexpressed genes were identified with weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) as implemented in the R package WGCNA by Langfelder and Horvath (2008). WGCNA called 13 modules that contained 7030 genes in total, while an additional 6830 genes were gathered in the gray module, which contains genes that have not been clustered in any module (i.e., unassigned genes; Figure 3). Using an ANOVA, we determined that five modules (turquoise, blue, green, pink, and magenta) out of the original 13 modules showed significant association with treatment (P < 0.001). Two of these modules (turquoise and blue) contained the majority of the associated genes. The turquoise module (3052 genes) corresponds to up-regulation of autophagy categories as well as heat-shock response and programmed cell death, which are components of the generic extra- and/or intra-cellular stress response (Figure 3). Expectedly, there is a strong interconnection of the categories in this module to several heat shock protein (HSP) genes (Supplementary Figure S6A). The blue module (2007 genes) is associated with several metabolic processes that are downregulated in response to stress (Figure 3). Two genes within this module exhibit a particularly large negative fold-change: CG16700 and MFS9 (Major Facilitator Superfamily Transporter 9), both of which are involved in transmembrane activity (Gaudet et al. 2011). An additional three genes within this module also stand out because they are connected to multiple sub-modules, and therefore are likely to affect more pathways: Got1 (Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1), aralar1 (CG2139; a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of genes), and CG18003 (Hao). Got1 and aralar1 are functionally involved in glutamate activity (Gaudet et al. 2011) and connect the categories involving metabolism of carbohydrates, glucose, and amino acids. CG18003 (Hao), which is predicted to have (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase activity, connects fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism (Supplementary Figure S6B)., Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA): (A) Number of genes in the final merged modules, (B) Reactome dotplot of enriched terms for the turquoise module, (C) Reactome dotplot of enriched terms for the blue module.

P-values (“p.adjust”) are adjusted according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The number of genes in a pathway is encoded in the dot size (count)., Using the full dataset, we detected an overall increase in the expression of metallothionein genes in the oxidative stress samples relative to the controls, with highly significant increases for MtnA, MtnD, and MtnE (Figure 4). To examine if the general increase in MtnA could be associated to the indel polymorphism we assessed the expression within each background. We found that the up-regulation of MtnA occurred regardless of whether the deletion or nondeletion variant was present in the 3′ UTR (Figure 5), suggesting that MtnA plays a general and conserved role in the response to oxidative stress. To better determine the effect of the MtnA 3′ UTR indel on expression, we compared the sets of differentially expressed genes within pairs of nearly isogenic lines from Germany (M12 and M9) and Cyprus (C2) that had otherwise homogenized genetic backgrounds, as well as two isofemale lines from Malaysia (KL1 and KL2) that were homozygous for the deletion and nondeletion alleles, respectively. The nearly isogenic lines showed greatly reduced differentiation compared to isofemale lines in both DNA sequence and gene expression (Figure 6), although the extent of this reduction varied among the nearly isogenic pairs. For one of the Munich pairs (M12) genetic differentiation was less than 1% of that between isofemale lines, while for the other pair (M9) it was about 30%. For the Cyprus pair (C2) genetic differentiation was about 4% of that between isofemale lines. In contrast, the isofemale lines from Malaysia (KL1 and KL2), which differ for the MtnA indel, also differed greatly throughout their genomes, showing levels of sequence and expression divergence expected for independent, isofemale lines (Figure 6; Supplementary Table S5). As might be expected, there was considerable overlap among the genes responding to stress in the deletion and nondeletion lines in all backgrounds (Figure 7); however, there were significantly more differentially expressed genes (both up- and downregulated) in the deletion lines relative to the corresponding nondeletion lines in all comparisons (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion appears to have a consistent effect on the transcriptional response to oxidative stress in a way that is independent of MtnA expression (Figure 4) and stress tolerance (Figure 1). A potential explanation for this is that the 3′ UTR deletion may eliminate miRNA binding sites (Catalán et al. 2016), freeing up the interacting miRNAs to regulate the expression of other genes. To test this, we examined the expression of target genes regulated by miRNAs predicted to bind within the 49-bp deletion region in the MtnA 3′ UTR (Catalán et al. 2016). For all of these miRNAs, there was a significant excess of downregulated target genes under oxidative stress (Figure 7), which is consistent with the greater availability of these miRNAs leading to increased negative regulation of their target genes. Furthermore, the downregulated target genes were enriched for those involved in regulatory and transcriptional processes (Supplementary Table S7). Thus, the observed excess of up-regulated genes in the deletion background (Figure 7) could be an indirect effect of miRNA regulation (i.e., the downregulation of miRNA target genes leading to up-regulation of other genes that interact with them)., MSB-induced log2 fold-change in expression (stress/control) of the metallothionein group genes MtnA, MtnB, MtnD, MtnE, and MtnF.

This design revealed modules of coexpressed genes induced by oxidative stress in the deletion background relative to the nondeletion background. Similar to the treatment only design, the major categories were turquoise (autophagy and general stress response) (Supplementary Figure S7A) and blue (metabolism) (Supplementary Figure S7B). However, we observed a decrease in the number of genes associated to each module and an overall reduction in the range of fold-changes, with many genes showing only small expression differences (log2 fold-change close to 0) (Supplementary Figure 7, A and B). Our analysis also uncovered two genes that showed an amplification of log2 fold-change compared to the treatment only design: Prosα4T2 (Proteasome alpha 4 subunit, Testis-specific 2), which was downregulated (blue module), and CG31792 (ATPase-coupled transmembrane transporter activity), which was up-regulated (turquoise module), in the deletion background under oxidative stress., The MtnA 3′ UTR deletion polymorphism previously has been associated with an increase in MtnA expression which, in turn, is associated with increased tolerance to oxidative stress (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). The previous studies, however, compared isofemale lines that differed not only in their MtnA alleles, but also at many loci throughout the genome. This approach makes it impossible to isolate the specific effect of the MtnA indel polymorphism on oxidative stress tolerance, or to detect potential interactions with other variants in the genomic background. The latter may be especially relevant, as oxidative stress tolerance is known to be a highly polygenic trait (Weber et al. 2012; Guio et al. 2014; Harrison et al. 2020). In the current study, we measured oxidative stress tolerance using lines from Germany and Cyprus in which the genetic background, aside from the MtnA locus, was homogenized through inbreeding. While this homogenization was successful in reducing genetic and expression variation (Figure 6), some residual polymorphism remained, especially in one of the German lines. In addition, we measured oxidative stress tolerance in a pair of inbred lines from Malaysia that differed in their MtnA 3′ UTR allele, but did not have a homogenized genomic background, and four independent isofemale lines from Zambia that had the ancestral, nondeletion MtnA allele., Our results indicate that the effect of the MtnA deletion on oxidative stress tolerance is highly dependent of the genomic background. In the two pairs of nearly isogenic lines from Germany, the deletion lines showed a significant reduction in mortality under oxidative stress compared to the corresponding nondeletion lines (Figure 1). Although there was a relatively high amount of residual polymorphism between the paired lines in one of the German backgrounds (M9), the concordant results observed in the two backgrounds suggest a consistent effect of the MtnA 3′ UTR indel polymorphism on oxidative stress tolerance. However, we cannot rule out a contribution from other polymorphic loci in the genome, especially in the M9 background. In contrast to the German background, the deletion had no detectable effect on oxidative stress tolerance in the Cypriot background, and was associated with a significant increase in mortality under stress in the Malaysian background (Figure 1). Thus, we find evidence for sign epistasis, in which the deletion has opposite effects depending on the genetic background. Note, however, that because the Malaysian background is not homogenized and there is considerable genetic and expression variation between the Malaysian lines (Figure 6), we cannot attribute the observed difference in stress tolerance solely to the MtnA indel polymorphism. Interestingly, the benefit of the deletion allele appears to be correlated with its frequency in the tested populations, with the greatest benefit in Germany (frequency = 0.91), no benefit in Cyprus (frequency = 0.65), and a significant cost in Malaysia (frequency = 0.45) (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). Thus, it may be that the beneficial effect of the MtnA deletion is dependent on an interaction with alleles at other loci that are in high frequency in temperate populations, which could contribute to its clinal distribution (Catalán et al. 2016), but confirmation of this trend would require additional experiments with a larger number of populations. The deletion is absent from the ancestral species range in sub-Saharan Africa, aside from rare alleles that appear to be caused by recent admixture with non-African populations (Ramnarine et al. 2019), suggesting that it conveys no selective advantage in sub-Saharan populations., The genes that show a consistent response to MSB exposure across all populations and genotypes can be considered part of the general oxidative stress response. In the following, we discuss the genes, functional categories, and expression modules that are part of this general response, as revealed by our transcriptomic analyses., Metallothioneins have been proposed to function as free radical scavengers and as antioxidants against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Thornalley and Vasák 1985; Abel and de Ruiter 1989; Cai et al. 2000). These genes are typically thought to have distinctive but overlapping functions involving metal ion homeostasis and detoxification (Egli et al. 2006; Atanesyan et al. 2011; Gaudet et al. 2011; Luo et al. 2020). In D. melanogaster, expression changes in MtnA have been demonstrated to be associated with oxidative stress tolerance (Catalán et al. 2016; Ramnarine et al. 2019). A new finding of the current study is that the expression of MtnA and two other metallothionein genes (MtnD and MtnE) is induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, MtnD and MtnE show an even higher induction of expression under stress than MtnA, while MtnB, MtnC, and MtnF show no sign of induction (Figure 4). These results suggest that the members of the metallothionein family have diversified in both function and regulation., GO enrichment analysis revealed a strong connection between oxidative stress and metabolism, specifically redox reactions involving glutathione (GSH), and particularly glutathione-S-transferase genes (GSTs). Redox status is often measured as the ratio of GSH (reduced state) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG; oxidized state) and used as a marker for cellular toxicity due to oxidative stress (Bonilla et al., 2006). Therefore, GSTs may prove to be of further interest because of their functional association to cellular protection against oxidative stress-inducing agents (Mockett et al. 1999; Whitworth et al. 2005; Hayes and McLellan 2009). In this context, the mechanism by which MSB affects biological systems may be particularly relevant, as it involves reactive oxygen species generation through quinone redox cycling and/or electrophilic attack involving cellular nucleophiles, both of which are modulated by oxidation or conjugation of glutathione (Akman et al. 1985; Baker et al. 1996; Wallace et al. 2005; Elgawish et al. 2013). Treatment with menadione has therefore been associated to oxidative damage due to lipid peroxidation, depletion of cellular glutathione, and variation in expression of glutathione metabolic genes (Chang et al. 1992; Kavitha and Chandra 2014; Thomas et al. 2016). In addition, changes in the expression of GSTs may be linked to cold tolerance. For example, Glutathione S-transferase E8 (GstE8), which was identified in this study, was also identified as a cold tolerance candidate and as a genotype-environment interaction gene by von Heckel et al. (2016). In fact, many of the differentially expressed genes identified by von Heckel et al. (2016) and by our study overlap, which provides further evidence for there being shared pathways between cold tolerance and oxidative stress tolerance. It has been previously proposed that at the metabolic level, cold tolerance adaptations may involve changes in neighboring pathways such as those related to redox balance (MacMillan et al. 2016). In previous studies, MtnA expression showed a variable response to cold stress (MacMillan et al. 2016; von Heckel et al. 2016; Königer and Grath 2018; Teets and Hahn 2018), which contrasts with the uniform induction of MtnA under oxidative stress. This suggests that at least some of the metallothioneins respond specifically to oxidative stress and are not induced by stress in general. Nonetheless, the up-regulated GO term “response to stress” supports the idea that oxidative stress is linked to other stress responses. Within this category, we examined the top 20 differentially expressed genes with the largest log2 fold-change. Of these, 10 belong to the HSP gene family. The other genes include: Ets21C, Fst, Gadd45, mthl7, MtnE, TotB, Cht9, GstE1, Arc1, and CG31659. With the exception of GstE1, these genes are not known for their association to oxidative stress specifically but are involved in varied pathway responses to diverse stress stimuli. Notably, among these genes is one of the few genes implicated specifically in cold tolerance, Fst (Frost) (Colinet et al. 2010), which further suggests a mechanistic relationship between cold stress and oxidative stress., Among the GO terms with the lowest P-values and the greatest downregulation under oxidative stress are a small number of genes related to (1) regulatory processes: Thymidylate synthase (Ts) and cardinal (cd); (2) oxidation-reduction and catabolic processes: beta-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (Had1), Stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase (CG9747), Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), and Hexokinase-C (Hex-C); and (3) tracheal system development: Rebuf (reb), filzig (flz), and breathless (btl). Notably, previous work has indicated that several genes involved in tracheal system and/or cuticular development were up-regulated with cold acclimation (MacMillan et al. 2016). Thus, our observation that genes associated with tracheal system development are downregulated under oxidative stress may imply that the physiological response mechanisms differ between these two stresses. In addition, we observed an up-regulation of genes that were associated to the GO term “proteolysis.” Since several of the top differentially expressed genes in this category are functionally associated to cleavage of peptide bonds and have endopeptidase (e.g., Jon25Bii) or protease (e.g., snk) activity (Gaudet et al. 2011), we hypothesize that the up-regulation of these genes is in response to damage or modification of cellular proteins (Finkel and Holbrook 2000; Das et al. 2001; Pickering et al. 2013)., A potential limitation of performing GO enrichment analysis with lists of significantly differentially expressed genes is that one primarily observes how an individual gene relates to a functional category. This may overlook correlated expression patterns among genes or genes that have a significant impact based on associations with other genes. Therefore, we re-analyzed our data using WGCNA to identify further candidate genes (Langfelder and Horvath 2008). This approach can assist in the identification of clusters of correlated genes or putative pathways, represented as modules that may be involved in oxidative stress tolerance based on gene expression profiles. Using WGCNA, we can isolate key nodes that have multiple edges, because the malfunction of such genes would affect all connected genes and therefore represent possible interesting candidates for further investigation. In both WGCNA designs (“∼treatment” and “∼genotype: treatment”), the two main modules can be categorized as (1) autophagy and apoptosis (turquoise) and (2) metabolic processes (blue) (Figure 3). In the turquoise module, we observed the up-regulation of genes involved in the general stress response, including a group of highly connected HSP genes and genes related to ubiquitin protein ligase binding (Ubi-p5E, Ubi-p63E, and CG11700), which also connect multiple sub-modules. This may indicate a connection between oxidative stress response genes and those involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Gaudet et al. 2011; Shang and Taylor 2011). On the other hand, in the blue module we observed the gene glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase (Got1), which is involved in glutamate biosynthesis (Gaudet et al. 2011), and aralar1, which is a mitochondrial and calcium-binding carrier that catalyzes the calcium-dependent exchange of cytoplasmic glutamate with mitochondrial aspartate across the mitochondrial inner membrane (Gaudet et al. 2011). Thus, altered expression of Got1 and aralar1 may reflect either a direct effect of the ROS burden and/or a systematic attempt to attenuate oxidative stress conditions through metabolic management of glutamate (Schinder et al. 1996; Rival et al. 2004; Peng et al. 2019). When the MtnA genotype is included as a factor, Prosα4T2 (blue module) and CG31792 (turquoise module) were revealed as potentially relevant to oxidative stress tolerance in the deletion background relative to the nondeletion background. Prosα4T2, involved in proteasomal ubiquitin-independent protein catabolic process, has also been suggested to have important functional roles in spermatogenesis, which may indicate a trade-off between oxidative stress tolerance and male reproduction (Belote et al. 1998; Tsakiri et al. 2013)., In pairwise comparisons of cosmopolitan lines that differed in their MtnA indel genotype, we observed that a large portion of the differentially expressed genes were shared between lines, but that there was a greater number of differentially expressed genes under stress in the deletion background than in the nondeletion background (Figure 7). This differential expression did not always correspond to the expression level of the MtnA gene (Figure 5), suggesting that the deletion influences the expression of other genes through a mechanism that is independent of its effect on MtnA. One possibility is that the polymorphic region of the MtnA 3′ UTR contains binding sites for miRNAs, and when this region is deleted the miRNAs are free to regulate the expression of other genes. Consistent with this interpretation, several miRNAs have been predicted to have target sites that overlap with the 49-bp deletion region of the MtnA 3′ UTR (Catalán et al. 2016). Furthermore, the predicted target genes of these miRNAs show greater downregulation under stress in the deletion background compared to the nondeletion background (Figure 8). This would be expected if there is direct regulation of the target genes by these miRNAs, as miRNAs typically function in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by inducing mRNA degradation (Chen and Rajewsky 2007). However, there was also a significant excess of up-regulated genes under stress in the deletion background. This up-regulation is not likely to be mediated directly by miRNAs, which are predominantly involved in the negative regulation of gene expression. Instead, the up-regulation may be an indirect effect of miRNA regulation. That is, the downregulation of one gene by a miRNA leads to the up-regulation of a second gene through the action of one or more intermediate genes involved in a regulatory network. This interpretation is supported by the finding that genes in the functional categories: “regulation of gene expression” (59 genes), and particularly “negative regulation of gene expression” (35 genes), were overrepresented among the genes that were differentially expressed between deletion and nondeletion lines under oxidative stress (Supplementary Table S7). In addition, many of these genes fall into the general categories with the lowest P-values, “regulation of biological processes” (124 genes) and “regulation of cellular processes” (118 genes). One of the more common mechanisms associated to these terms is regulation of transcriptional activity via RNA Polymerase II (Supplementary Table S7), which is a key component in regulating gene expression. Interestingly, there were just three miRNA target genes associated to the ontology term “response to oxidative stress” but with potentially significant impact due to their diverse functionality and effect on transcriptional activity. One of these target genes is Adar (Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) an RNA-editing enzyme that has been proposed to facilitate temperature-dependent adaptive evolution through an epigenetic mechanism and downregulation of this gene has been shown to be associated to an increase in expression of genes encoding known ROS scavengers (Chen et al. 2004; Gaudet et al. 2011; Rieder et al. 2015; Duan et al. 2017). The other two targets are: alph (alphabet) a Serine/Threonine specific protein phosphatase that is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and per (period), a gene essential for biological clock functions (Gaudet et al. 2011). Alph may represent a potential candidate to investigate our hypothesis concerning the adaptive benefits and indirect regulatory capabilities of the MtnA indel-associated miRNAs. Alph is involved in the negative regulation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, therefore downregulation of this gene augments JNK signaling, which induces protective genes that confer increased oxidative stress tolerance (Wang et al. 2003; Baril et al. 2009). Another example here is the downregulation of per which is phenotypically associated to pathological effects on circadian rhythms and aging but may also have metabolic benefits which control longevity (Krishnan et al. 2009; Ulgherait et al. 2020)., Log2 fold-changes (stress/control) of downregulated target genes of miRNAs with predicted binding sites within the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion region (miR-284-3p, miR-956-3p, miR-9c-5p, and bantam-3p). Two target genes that fall below the limits of the y-axis (log2 fold-change <−1.5) are not shown in the plot, but were included in the statistical analysis. Differences between the deletion and nondeletion background were tested using a paired sample Wilcoxon test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001., Log2 fold-changes (stress/control) of downregulated target genes of miRNAs with predicted binding sites within the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion region (miR-284-3p, miR-956-3p, miR-9c-5p, and bantam-3p).

Differences between the deletion and nondeletion background were tested using a paired sample Wilcoxon test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001., In summary, we have demonstrated that the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in oxidative stress tolerance are strongly associated to metabolism and DNA/protein damage and repair. Moreover, our transcriptomic data suggest that this response overlaps with genes responding to cold tolerance and that metallothionein genes (MtnA, MtnD, and MtnE) may operate collaboratively in response to oxidative stress. To further investigate the functional elements associated to these two stress responses and their roles in clinal or local adaptation, future studies may utilize combined or parallel oxidative stress and cold stress treatments on lines with precisely controlled genomic backgrounds. In addition, a candidate gene approach involving oxidative and cold stress with single gene knockout/knockdown lines could be employed. With regards to the MtnA indel polymorphism and its effect on oxidative stress tolerance, our data imply that the associated phenotype is dependent on alleles at other loci in the genetic background. Therefore, a logical progression of this study may involve experimental work including expression, tolerance, and transcriptomic analyses of a larger number of natural population backgrounds that have been subjected to direct genetic manipulation of the MtnA indel region using gene editing techniques. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence for the involvement of miRNAs in the response to oxidative stress, which may be part of the mechanism by which the MtnA 3′ UTR deletion affects the expression of MtnA and other genes. In the future, reporter genes, small-RNA sequencing, and/or transgenic lines (e.g., UAS-miRNA) could be used to confirm specific miRNA-mRNA interactions and to functionally evaluate the regulatory capabilities of miRNAs associated with the MtnA 3′ UTR., Gene expression data are available at GEO under the accession number GSE174813.

Our approach addresses concerns about reproducibility and demonstrates how to obtain robust results from mapping complex traits in any genome-wide association study., Combining samples, through meta- or mega-analysis, has become routine in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits as a way to augment power by increasing sample size and to ensure robustness of results by replicating findings. Genetic mapping of complex traits in rodents has favored the use of linkage analysis in crosses between inbred strains, with many different inbred strain combinations being employed. In addition, few studies examine the same phenotypes. Therefore, few rodent studies have lent themselves to meta- or mega-analysis (Wuschke et al. 2007; Schmidt et al. 2008). However, the more recent transition to genetic association using outbred mice (Parker and Palmer 2011; Flint and Eskin 2012; Chesler 2014) or panels of inbred animals (Ghazalpour et al. 2012) provides opportunities for deploying meta- (Kang et al. 2014) and mega-analysis (Chitre et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020) to increase power and test reproducibility., In this paper, we combine results from two independent laboratories, one at the University of Oxford (OX) in the United Kingdom (Nicod et al. 2016) and one at the University of Chicago (UC) in the United States of America (Parker et al. 2016). Both experiments sampled from the same population of commercially available outbred mice [Crl:CFW(SW)-US_P08, hereafter CFW], but differed in genotyping platforms, and in some of the phenotyping assays. The combined sample size of 3076 mice is the largest cohort to date for the 23 phenotypes examined. The increased sample size and variety of physiological and behavioral phenotypes provided an opportunity to examine several questions that have not been fully addressed in mouse GWAS., While a consensus has arisen in human GWAS that a 5× 10−8 threshold together with replication in an independent sample is sufficient to declare locus discovery (Pe’er et al. 2008; Visscher et al. 2012), the same is not true for mouse studies. Mouse populations used for GWAS differ substantially, in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, allele frequencies, and the extent of relatedness between subjects, making it inappropriate to codify a single significance threshold (Flint and Eskin 2012). Furthermore, the selection of a genome-wide significance threshold introduces a bias known as “Winner’s Curse” or the “Beavis effect,” in which loci passing the genome-wide significance threshold tend to have inflated effect sizes (Zhong and Prentice 2008; Xiao and Boehnke 2009; Sun et al. 2011). Winner’s Curse contributes substantially to lack of replication of GWAS loci in follow-up studies (Palmer and Pe’er 2017). There have also been concerns about the impact of laboratory differences on the measurement of behavior (Crabbe et al. 1999) and the potentially large impact of subtle laboratory effects (Valdar et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2020). These differences between studies can contribute to study-specific heterogeneity, which can lead to spurious associations when combining studies. We refer to unintended effects present in one study but not others as confounders. These issues question the generalizability of genetic analyses., Here we performed a mega-analysis between the OX and UC cohorts and identified 70 independent loci, of which 41 were not found in component studies. Novel loci can result from the increase in power from combining data in a mega-analysis, or they can result from study-specific heterogeneity between the component studies. To investigate the robustness of the novel associations in the mega-analysis, we integrate assessments of heritability, genetic correlation, locus-specific replication, estimates of study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding (Zou et al. 2020), and Winner’s Curse corrected estimates of power (Zhong and Prentice 2008) to categorize loci into one of four confidence levels. We then performed fine-mapping analysis and annotation of nonsynonymous variants to identify putative genes for a number of phenotypes., All animals originated from the same colony of outbred mice, the Crl:CFW(SW)-US_P08 stock, maintained by Charles River Laboratories in Portage, Michigan at the time of the study. Details about the OX and UC mice are described elsewhere (Nicod et al. 2016; Parker et al. 2016). The OX mice were purchased between December 2009 and September 2011 at 4–7 weeks of age and phenotyping started at 16 weeks. The UC mice arrived at 7 weeks of age between August 2011 and December 2012, and testing started after a 2-week acclimatization period. Both the OX and UC mice were maintained on a standard 12:12 h light–dark cycle with water and standard laboratory chow available ad libitum and housed 3 (OX) or 4 (UC) per cage., The effect of covariates, including sex, weight, and batch, was tested in each data set separately (OX and UC) and introduced in a linear model to calculate residuals when the effect was significant (weight was retained for mapping body weight). OX and UC residuals were then quantile-normalized before being merged in a single data set used for the genetic analysis. Supplementary Data S1 lists the mean and standard deviation of all measures obtained in both studies and the covariates included in the linear model to calculate the residuals. Many of the behavioral phenotypes were not independent. For example, there were multiple phenotypes within the category of locomotor activity. They represent measures related to locomotor activity at different timepoints during the testing period (e.g., 0–15, 15–30 min, etc.) as well as summary data representing changes in activity over time (e.g., activity decay) that are likely correlated. Descriptions of all phenotypes can be found in Supplementary Table S1. The following section describes methodological differences between OX and UC. Further details of methods applied in the individual studies can be found in separate publications (Nicod et al. 2016; Parker et al. 2016)., In both centers the baseline activity of the mice was recorded during the first 30 min of testing. The activity of the OX mice was recorded at 16 weeks after placement into a new plastic home cage (46 cm×15 cm×21 cm) using a photoactivity system from San Diego Instruments (San Diego, CA, USA) which has seven infrared photobeams crossing the width of the cage floor., The UC mice, ∼51 days of age at the time of test (SD = 4), were injected i.p. with physiological saline (0.01 ml/g body weight) immediately prior to the test and placed in the center of an OF chamber (AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH) consisting of a clear acrylic arena (40 cm×40 cm×30 cm) placed inside a frame containing evenly spaced infrared photobeams., Four phenotypes were analyzed for this study: locomotor activity initial (0–15 min), locomotor activity end (15–30 min), locomotor activity total (0–30 min), and activity decay. Activity decay was defined as the decrease in activity from beginning to end., In OX, conditioned fear (CF) was tested over 2 days in four San Diego Instruments chambers with mice at 17 weeks of age. On the first day of the test mice were subjected to a 13-min training session during which they received two electric foot shocks (0.3 mA, 0.5 s) preceded by a 30-s tone. In the morning of the second day of the test the mice were placed in the same enclosure for 5 min and fear associated with the context was measured by the amount of freezing. In the afternoon the animals were placed in a different enclosure for 5 min where they were subjected to two 30-s tones without any paired electric shock. Freezing behavior during all sessions of the test was scored using a VideoTrack automated system (Viewpoint, Champagne Au Mont D’Or, France)., UC mice were tested for CF at ∼63 days of age (SD = 2.9) over three consecutive days, each consisting of a 7-min trial: on the first test day, mice were conditioned to associate a test chamber and a tone (85 dB, 3 kHz tone lasting 30 s) with a shock (2-s, 0.5-mA foot shock delivered four times); on the second test day, the mice were re-exposed to the same context, but no tones or shocks were given; on the third day, mice were exposed to the conditioned stimulus (the tones), but in a different environment. Mice were tested in four chambers obtained from Med Associates (St. Albans, VT, USA) and immobility, or “freezing” behavior, was recorded by analyzing digital video with Freeze Frame software (Actimetrics, Evanston, IL, USA)., Phenotypes from the conditioned fear tests consisted of eight measurements of immobility collected in OX and UC mice. On day 1, we measured average proportion of freezing during the pretraining interval (UC: 30–180 s, OX: 180–355 s) before exposure to tones and shocks (baseline freezing D1), as well as the average proportion of freezing during exposure to the first conditioned stimulus corrected for baseline freezing (corrected freezing to tone alone). On day 2, we measured freezing during the context test corrected for baseline (corrected freezing to context). On day 3, we measured the average proportion of time freezing in the altered setting during the 30-s intervals in which the tones were presented corrected for baseline (corrected freezing to cue). These measurements were done on day 2 in Oxford and on day 3 in UC., UC mice were tested at a mean age of 74.5 days (SD = 2.2). During prepulse inhibition (PPI), the mice were exposed to loud pulses (120 dB) that caused them to exhibit the startle response. Occasionally, the exposure to the loud pulse was preceded by a barely perceptible “prepulse” (3–12 dB over background levels), which inhibited the startle response to varying extents. The UC PPI testing procedures follow protocols detailed in previous papers (Palmer et al. 2000, 2004; Palmer and Airey 2003; Shanahan et al. 2009)., OX mice were tested at ∼17 weeks of age following a different protocol (Yee et al. 2005) combining exposure to loud pulses of three different intensities (100, 110, and 120 dB), also preceded by 3–12 dB prepulses. For this analysis, only measures of startle elicited by the 120 dB pulse (similar to UC) were considered., Both OX and UC prepulse inhibition tests were performed in chambers and apparatus from the same manufacturer and model (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA), capturing mouse movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer, then converted into digital data and recorded on a computer. Before the start of each test day, the apparatuses were calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions., Five phenotypes were analyzed for this study: startle habituation difference, startle habituation ratio, startle, PPI with +6 db prepulse, and PPI with +12 db prepulse. In UC, startle habituation difference was defined as the average startle amplitude during the fourth pulse-alone trials subtracted from the average startle amplitude during the first pulse-alone trials. In OX this was calculated by subtracting the last block from the first block for the 120 dB stimulus. In UC, startle habituation ratio was defined as the average startle amplitude during the first pulse-alone trials divided by the average startle amplitude during the fourth pulse-alone trials. In OX, this was calculated by dividing the first block for the 120 dB stimulus by the last block. Startle was defined as the average startle amplitude to the 120 db pulses during the second and third blocks. PPI with +6 db prepulse was defined as the average prepulse inhibition during blocks 1 and 2 to the 6 dB prepulse. PPI with +12 db prepulse was defined as the average prepulse inhibition during blocks 1 and 2 to the 12 dB prepulse., Weight of hind limb muscles and length of tibia were collected by the same experimenter for both the OX and UC mice. Following sacrifice, at ∼20 weeks for the OX mice and ∼90 days of age for the UC mice (M = 91.2, SD = 2.6), one leg was cutoff just below pelvis, tubed, and transferred into a −70°C freezer, then shipped on dry ice to Dr Arimantas Lionikas at the University of Aberdeen. On the day of dissection, the leg was defrosted and two dorsiflexors, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and three plantar flexors, gastrocnemius (gastroc), plantaris, and soleus, were removed under a dissection microscope and weighed to a precision of 0.1 mg on a balance (Pioneer, Ohaus). Then, the soft tissues were stripped off from the tibia, and the length of the tibia was measured to a precision of 0.01 mm with a digital caliper (Z22855, OWIM GmbH & Co)., In the OX mice, bone mineral content of the tibia was measured with the Faxitron MX-20 scanner (Faxitron Bioptics LLC, AZ, USA) using methods adapted from (Bassett et al. 2012). ImageJ (V1.48p, National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to quantify the apparent bone mineral content and the mean of the value obtained for the entire bone used for analysis. In the UC mice, bone mineral density for the entire isolated femur was assessed by Dual X-ray absorptiometry using a GE-Lunar PIXImus II Densitometer (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI, USA). To admit a normal distribution, we transformed the BM measurements, which were ratios, to the (base 10) log-scale. Lastly, we measured abnormal BMD, which is a dichotomized version of the BMD phenotype, and the only phenotype collected that was not quantitative., Body weight was measured at ∼17 weeks in OX mice and at ∼13 weeks of age (91.2, SD = 2.6) in UC mice. Tail length (in cm) was measured at the time of sacrifice, as the distance from the base of the tail to the tip of the tail (OX: ∼20 weeks of age; UC: same as body weight measurement)., Sample BAM preprocessing including mapping and quality control is as previously described (Nicod et al. 2016; Parker et al. 2016). Reads were aligned to the reference genome assembly (NCBI release 38, mm10). Imputation was carried out using STITCH (Davies et al. 2016) (Supplementary Methods). The 3.15 M SNPs from STITCH were filtered for low quality variant calls (INFO < 0.90) and pruned for LD using PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007), resulting in 97,452 SNPs tested for association with the phenotypes. Using PLINK’s hard calling threshold, the dosages were converted to genotype calls. Jointly calling the OX and UC samples in this manner generated a high confidence set of SNPs that was different from those used in their prior studies (Nicod et al. 2016; Parker et al. 2016)., The genotype likelihoods at 97,452 independent SNPs, obtained using STITCH, were used to perform associated studies in the joint set of Oxford and Chicago samples. The genotype likelihoods were converted to dosages of the alternate allele. Using the dosages for the combined set of samples, association analyses were performed using linear mixed models in GEMMA (v0.96) (Zhou and Stephens 2012) with a precalculated genetic relationship matrix (GRM) also from GEMMA. Phenotypes were converted to normal quantiles after removing the effects of age and sex, all analyses performed using the R progamming language (R Development Core Team 2010). We did not convert into normal quantiles within sex because sex was used as a covariate to generate the residuals, thus removing the difference in the means. In addition to performing the association analyses on the combined set of Oxford and Chicago samples, association analyses were also performed on the individual sample sets (OX and UC). Finally, the Oxford sample set was randomly split into two equal sized samples sets 100 times. Association analyses were performed on these Oxford subsets as well. Independent QTLs were obtained using a peak caller (Nicod et al. 2016), where the QTLs with the highest log P-values were retained. The code for the peak caller is available on the Github repository (Data availability)., The significance thresholds for the P-values from the linear mixed model association analyses were computed in two different permutation approaches. First, we used a “naïve” permutation approach (Cheng and Palmer 2013). In this approach, for each phenotype, we permuted the phenotype values across the combined set of samples. Then the association analysis was repeated on the permuted phenotypes, and the most significant P-value was retained. For each phenotype, the naïve permutation analysis was repeated 100 times, resulting in a total of 2300 most significant P-values. The permutation threshold was computed as the fifth percentile of the distribution of the most significant P-values from across all phenotypes; combining the phenotypes was justified because all phenotypes had been converted to normal quantiles, therefore they had identical distributions. The same permutation threshold was then used for all phenotypes. Separate P-value permutation thresholds were computed for the different sample sets: combined, OX, UC, and the two Oxford subsets (OX1 and OX2)., We compared the naïve permutation method to using another permutation approach—henceforth referred to as the “decorrelated” method (Abney 2015). First, the centered GRM was computed using the genotype dosages from all the chromosomes. Then the inverse square root of the GRM was computed. The phenotype and genotype vectors are premultiplied by the inverse square root of the GRM, resulting in decorrelated measurements. Since the phenotypes and the genotypes are decorrelated, a linear model is used instead of a linear mixed model, resulting in faster computation times. For each phenotype, 100 permutation replicates were performed by permuting the decorrelated phenotypes and performing association analyses using linear models. Similar to the naïve approach, the most-significant P-value was retained from each permutation replicate across the 2300 phenotype-replicate combinations. Again, the significance threshold was computed as the 5th percentile of the distribution of the most-significant P-values. The significance thresholds obtained using the decorrelated method were close to the naive permutation method (Supplementary Figure S6). Since the decorrelated method was less computationally intensive, and the two approaches led to very similar significance thresholds, we use the thresholds obtained using the decorrelated method for our results., We constructed local LD weighted genetic relatedness matrices (GRMs) using imputed dosages at the common set of SNPs for Oxford and Chicago studies separately, and a combined GRM for all mice in both studies, using LDAK version 5.9 (Speed et al. 2012). We then inferred “narrow-sense” heritability from genome-wide SNPs (h2) at 23 phenotypes measured in both studies, and genetic correlations (rG) between the two component studies in phenotypes with nonzero heritability. Estimates for h2 at each phenotype were obtained using the individual study GRMs using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) implemented in LDAK, while rG for each phenotype was estimated with the combined GRM using bivariate REML implemented in GCTA version 1.93.2 (Yang et al. 2011). All h2 and rG calculations were made with PCs 1 to 20 from PCA on the respective GRMs included as fixed effect covariates. We performed a mega-analysis for all phenotypes with significantly nonzero rG (P < 0.05)., Confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by simulation. At each QTL, a residual phenotype was constructed by removing the effect of the top SNP at the QTL from the phenotype vector used in the QTL mapping above. This abolished the effect attributable to the QTL whilst maintaining genetic contributions from elsewhere in the genome. One thousand SNPs were then randomly selected, subject to the constraint that they were within 2.5 Mb of the top SNP and were polymorphic in the subset of individuals phenotyped for the trait. A causal variant was simulated at the SNP, with an effect size matching that of the top SNP, taking account of the allele frequency, and added to the residual phenotype. A local scan of the region using the same mixed model but the simulated phenotype was performed and the location and log P of the simulated top SNP recorded. Across the 1000 simulations, we estimated the distribution of the drop Δ in log P between the simulated top SNP and the simulated causal SNP (this was zero when the top and causal SNPs coincided). We used the fraction of simulations f(Δ) within Δ to determine CIs for the original phenotype data. Thus, we identified the range of SNPs within 1.5 Mb of the top SNP and with a log P drop less than Δ to define the 100f(Δ)% CI for the QTL. We used the pruned SNPs within the 95% CIs as input to the SusieR fine-mapping method. We ran the SusieR method (Wang et al. 2020) using the susie_rss function with L = 1 and coverage = 0.95. We annotated all variants within the 95% causal sets and all variants in perfect LD using ANNOVAR (Wang et al. 2010)., We applied two random effects models proposed in Zou et al. (2020). The z-scores of the significant variants in the discovery study and the corresponding z-scores in the replication study are used as input to learn the three unknown parameters (⁠σg2⁠, σc12⁠, σc22⁠) using maximum likelihood. σg2 is the variance in the true effect size. σc12 and σc22 are the variances in the study-specific effects for the discovery and replication studies, respectively. The first model (WC) only corrects for Winner’s Curse and assumes that the discovery and replication studies have a shared genetic effect (⁠λ∼N(0, σg2)⁠). This model corrects for Winner’s Curse by modeling the conditional distribution of the replication statistics given discovery statistics (sk(2)|sk(1)=x, σg2 ∼N (N1N2σg2N1σg2+1x, 1+N2 σg2-N2σg2N1σg2+1))⁠, where N1 and N2 are the sample sizes of the discovery and replication studies, respectively, and k is a genetic locus used as input to the method. The second (WC+C) corrects for both Winner’s Curse and study-specific effects for the discovery (⁠δ(1)⁠) and replication studies (⁠δ(2)⁠), where δ(1)∼N(0, σc12) and δ(2)∼N(0, σc22)⁠. This model corrects for both Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity using a similar conditional distribution (⁠sk(2)|sk(1)=x, σg2,σc12, σc22 ∼N (N1N2σg2N1σc12+N1σg2+1x, 1+N2σg2+N2σc22-N1N2σg4N1σc12+N1σg2+1)⁠, where x is the value of the z-score in the discovery study. We apply this method only to the nine phenotypes with at least three significant loci., We compared the expected replication rate under the two models to the observed replication. The observed replication was computed as the fraction of variants that were significant in discovery study that were also nominally significant and having the same sign in the replication study. The expected replication rate (r) under each model was computed as r=1M∑k=1MP(abs(sk(2))>z | sk(1)=x)⁠, where M is the number of variants significant in the discovery study, and z is the significance threshold for the replication study., where βobs is the observed effect size, σ is the standard error, c is the significance threshold, ϕ(x) is the standard normal density function, and ψ(x) is the standard normal cumulative density function., We use the estimates of the true effect size to compute the power as the probability of observing a significant result under a normal distribution (⁠sk(1)∼N((βtrue/σ)⁠, 1))., We provide an overview of our methodology in Figure 1, which shows the numbers of phenotypes, QTLs, and genes that we identified at each stage of the analysis., Method overview. We combined two cohorts of CFW mice for 23 shared phenotypes. We identified 17 phenotypes with heritability significantly >0. Fifteen of these phenotypes had genetic correlations >0.70. We performed GWAS meta-analysis using these 15 phenotypes and obtained 70 genome-wide significant QTLs., Method overview. We combined two cohorts of CFW mice for 23 shared phenotypes. We identified 17 phenotypes with heritability significantly >0. Fifteen of these phenotypes had genetic correlations >0.70. We performed GWAS meta-analysis using these 15 phenotypes and obtained 70 genome-wide significant QTLs., We identified 23 phenotypes that were measured in both studies (Supplementary Table S1 and Data S1). We observed a high correlation between related phenotypes, such as “locomotor activity initial” and “locomotor activity total” (Supplementary Figure S1). To obtain a common set of genotypes, we converted sequence data into genotypes using a single pipeline and obtained a common set of 3,152,108 SNPs for mapping with MAF > 0.001. Quality control data for genotypes are shown in Supplementary Figures S2–S4. We also genotyped a subset of these mice on the megaMUGA array (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012), and observed 98.71% concordance for the OX cohort and 97.14% concordance for the UC cohort. We also compared the overlapping SNPs to our prior publications and found 99.12% concordance for OX and 91.87% concordance for UC. After filtering the imputed genotypes for pairwise r2 (>0.999), 97,452 SNPs were retained for subsequent mapping (Supplementary Data S2). For all phenotypes, residuals were obtained by regressing out the relevant covariates in a linear model. These residuals were converted to normal quantiles within each cohort and then combined for the mega-analysis., To determine the degree of concordance between the OX and UC component studies, we computed genetic correlations using bivariate genome-based restricted maximum likelihood estimates, implemented in the GCTA software package (Yang et al. 2011) (Figure 2). Genetic correlations were obtained for 17 of the 23 phenotypes with nonzero heritabilities (Supplementary Table S2) using samples from both studies. We use these 17 phenotypes for further analyses since phenotypes with low heritability and genetic correlation are unlikely to have genome-wide significant associations. For these analyses, we used a set of pruned variants with INFO > 0.90. As a control, we performed the same analyses using two cohorts that were obtained by randomly splitting the OX cohort in half (termed the OX1 and OX2). Theoretically, there should be little heterogeneity between OX1 and OX2, so the genetic correlation should be close to 1., The genetic correlation between each pair of phenotypes mapped in OX and UC studies. Each dot represents the estimated genetic correlation, and the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals obtained using the standard errors. Only phenotypes with heritability significantly different from zero are shown. Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1., The genetic correlation between each pair of phenotypes mapped in OX and UC studies. Each dot represents the estimated genetic correlation, and the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals obtained using the standard errors. Only phenotypes with heritability significantly different from zero are shown. Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1., As expected, the genetic correlation between OX1 and OX2 was indeed close to 1 for all phenotypes (Supplementary Figure S5). The standard errors on the genetic correlations were high when the estimated heritability for the trait was low. Figure 2 shows that genetic correlations between OX and UC were >0.7 for phenotypes with heritability greater than or equal to 15%, indicating that the studies have substantial shared genetic association signal. Behavioral phenotypes, such as startle and fear conditioning, tended to have lower heritabilities (Supplementary Table S2) than the physiological traits. However, this may be in part due to differences in methodology between the OX and UC studies (see Methods)., We performed a mega-analysis of 23 traits in the combined OX and UC cohorts (3076 mice, Supplementary Data S3). We compared two different permutation-based methods (“naive” and “decorrelated”) to obtain thresholds at a significance level of 0.05 (see Methods; Supplementary Figure S6). We used the more conservative decorrelated thresholds for our analysis. We identified 70 independent loci that were significant at an empirically derived −log P threshold of 5.79 (Figure 3)., Porcupine plot showing a genome-wide representation of all QTLs identified for all traits. Light gray dots show association for the measures where a QTL was detected. SNPs at each locus that exceed a permutation derived significance threshold are marked with a colored dot, where blue represents physiological and red behavioral traits. Significance thresholds were derived using a decorrelated permutation approach, described in the methods section. While some of these QTLs represent closely linked loci for similar traits, some loci are shared between physiological (blue) and behavioral (red) traits., Porcupine plot showing a genome-wide representation of all QTLs identified for all traits. Light gray dots show association for the measures where a QTL was detected. SNPs at each locus that exceed a permutation derived significance threshold are marked with a colored dot, where blue represents physiological and red behavioral traits. Significance thresholds were derived using a decorrelated permutation approach, described in the methods section. While some of these QTLs represent closely linked loci for similar traits, some loci are shared between physiological (blue) and behavioral (red) traits., The genetic architecture of the phenotypes is polygenic; namely many loci each contribute a small effect to the heritability (Supplementary Table S3). Figure 3 shows that the log P values for behavior (red dots in the figure) are on average less than those for physiological traits (blue dots). The absolute median effect size for the behavioral loci was 0.16 and 0.18 for physiological traits, indicating that the behavioral QTLs tended to have smaller effect sizes than the physiological QTLs. Supplementary Table S3 lists the positions of all genome-wide significant loci for every phenotype, giving their log P and effect sizes., We estimated the 95% CI for every QTL using a previously published simulation procedure in which, for each locus, we randomly implanted causal SNPs that matched the true QTL’s observed effect size and simulated phenotypes for all samples (Nicod et al. 2016). A local scan of the region using the mixed model was then performed using the simulated phenotypes, and the location and P-value of the top SNP was recorded. These simulations were used to compute the empirical distribution of the change in P-value between the most highly associated SNP and the causal SNP (Δ). The 95% CI was estimated as the maximum Δ among the lowest 95% of simulations. Supplementary Table S3 contains the CIs estimated for all QTLs found in the mega-analysis. Figure 4 shows several examples of CIs computed for two QTLs. Most CIs coincide with strong LD blocks, as expected (Figure 4A). However, in some cases, the CIs included variants with low correlation to the lead SNP (Figure 4B). Thus, the CIs are able to identify regions responsible for the peak signal in a less arbitrary way than simple LD thresholds. These CIs were computed using the LD pruned variants. We use these variants to simplify the sim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lations for the CI estimation and the subsequent fine-mapping. However, we add variants in LD for downstream analyses of the variants. Supplementary Figure S7 shows the distribution of the 95% CI widths of all QTLs, which range from 0.09–7.96 Mb, with a median of 1.3 Mb., High-resolution mapping of two QTLs. Each point is a variant in the locus, and the color of the point corresponds to the correlation of that variant with the lead SNP. The vertical lines correspond to the 95% confidence interval estimated for the QTL. Genes falling within the confidence intervals are shown below the plot.

The confidence intervals include many variants with low correlation to the lead SNP., In order to identify putative causal variants within the 95% CIs previously computed, we applied a fine-mapping framework called susieR (Wang et al. 2020). We used summary statistics from an LD pruned set (R2 < 0.99) of variants and the LD between these variants as input to susieR. SusieR uses these variants to compute a number of credible sets that are designed to contain the causal variant with high probability (i.e., 95%). We obtained credible sets of SNPs for 62/70 QTLs for which the fine-mapping algorithm converged. Table 1 provides examples in which the fine-mapping was particularly effective. For example, a QTL we identified for tibia length (chr6:145481081) had over 15,000 SNPs in the 95% CI of the QTL, and after fine-mapping, the number of putative SNPs was only 169 (representing a 99% reduction in the number of putative SNPs). The median number of variants in the credible sets was 932, and the median reduction in set size was 51% (Supplementary Figure S8 and Data S4). Across all phenotypes and loci, we identified 94,177 variants in the credible sets or in high LD (R2 > 0.99) of variants in the credible sets. We used the variants within these credible sets as a high confidence set of variants for downstream analysis.,  Examples of fine-mapping QTLs, “All SNPs” refers to the total number of SNPs used as input to the SusieR fine-mapping method, and “Fm SNPs” corresponds to the number of variants in the credible sets. “Reduction” is the percentage of decrease relative to the total number of SNPs used as input to the fine mapping.,  Examples of fine-mapping QTLs, “All SNPs” refers to the total number of SNPs used as input to the SusieR fine-mapping method, and “Fm SNPs” corresponds to the number of variants in the credible sets. “Reduction” is the percentage of decrease relative to the total number of SNPs used as input to the fine mapping., We generated gene-based annotations for the variants in the credible sets using the ANNOVAR software. Ninety-nine percentage of variants were in noncoding regions of the genome. 32 variants in the credible sets were nonsynonymous mutations within 22 coding genes (compared to 4 nonsynonymous variants in UC and 16 nonsynonymous variants in OX). We interrogated the NHGRI-EBI catalog of human GWAS and the Mouse Genome Informatics database to determine if any of these 22 genes have been previously associated with relevant traits of interest (Supplementary Table S4). Of the 22 coding genes identified, 11 were previously implicated in either human GWAS or KO mouse studies of similar traits (Supplementary Table S4)., We examined the effect of the 70 QTL significant in the mega-analysis on the other 23 traits, to determine the extent of colocalization between traits. We found that 45/70 QTLs had effects on more than one trait, after applying a Bonferroni correction (P < 5.1e−05) for multiple testing of combinations of QTLs and other phenotypes. Phenotypes often derive from the same test (such as activity measured over different lengths of time or measures obtained from different muscles). To report our results we created two phenotype categories (Behavior and Physiology). Results are shown in Supplementary Figure S9 and Table S5. While the majority of these colocalized traits are between similar traits, such as locomotor activity at different time points, 20 of 45 QTLs had effects on at least one behavioral trait and one physiological trait. For example, a QTL for initial locomotor activity (chr11:96964818) was also associated with total locomotor activity, locomotor activity end, weight of TA, tibia length, BMD, and abnormal BMD. Similarly, a QTL for weight (chr13:9217096) was also associated with soleus, weight of TA, EDL, total locomotor activity, locomotor activity end, and locomotor activity initial., Despite the high genetic correlations between phenotypes in the OX and UC studies (Figure 2), we observed a high rate of nonreplication of QTLs, where replication was defined as a genome-wide significant association in the “discovery” data set (OX or UC) and a P-value of 0.05 or lower in the other (“replication”) data set. After mapping all traits in either just the OX or just the UC sample and applying empirically derived thresholds (−log P 5.68 for OX, 5.43 for UC), we identified 32 QTLs in the OX data set and 22 in the UC data set. Six of the 32 QTL discovered in OX replicated in the UC (19%); of the 22 QTL identified in UC, 7 replicated in OX (32%). There were also instances where the mega-analysis failed to confirm findings in a component study (12 of 22 loci from UC and 4 of 32 loci from OX, Supplementary Figure S10). Forty-one of 70 loci were significant in the mega-analysis but not significant in the component studies (Table 2).,  The number of QTLs significant in the mega-analysis (“mega-analysis”) and the number of the QTLs from the mega-analysis that were also found in each of the component studies (“OX” and “UC”), Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1.,  The number of QTLs significant in the mega-analysis (“mega-analysis”) and the number of the QTLs from the mega-analysis that were also found in each of the component studies (“OX” and “UC”), Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1., We explored the contributions of power and confounders (which are presumed to reflect experimental differences between studies) to replication rates in our samples. When power is low, variants that pass the significance threshold are more likely to have inflated effect size estimates, meaning they are less likely to be replicated, a phenomenon that is often called “The Winner’s Curse.” Put another way, when power is low, the positive predictive value falls, so that for a given P-value there will be more false positives., We applied a statistical framework that jointly models Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding (Zou et al. 2020). The inputs to this method are the z-scores of the significant variants from the discovery study and the corresponding z-scores from the replication study. The method compares two random effects models: one that accounts for Winner’s Curse (WC) and another that accounts for both Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding (WC + C). We compared the expected replication rates under each of these random effects models to the observed replication rates. If the observed replication rate is well explained by the WC model, there is relatively little heterogeneity. However, if the observed replication rate is better explained by the WC + C model, there may be heterogeneity between the studies., We used the OX cohort as the discovery data set and UC cohort as the replication data set. We jointly modeled Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity in nine phenotypes which had at least three significant loci [model parameters are not robustly estimated with fewer significant loci (Zou et al. 2020)]. We computed the expected replication rate under each model for each phenotype and compared these estimates with the observed replication between the two data sets. In order to estimate CIs we applied this method to 100 randomly divided sets of the OX sample (heterogeneity should not exist when a single study is randomly split in half into two cohorts). To display the results, we plotted the difference between the observed replication and the expected replication after correcting for Winner’s Curse, which should be close to zero when the model explains the observed data., Figure 5A shows the results modeling Winner’s Curse (WC). The estimate for one phenotype, EDL, overlaps with zero, but in all other cases the Winner’s Curse model predicts higher rates of replication than we observed. The WC + C model jointly models Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity. Taking into account confounds in addition to Winner’s Curse (WC + C) does a better job explaining the observed replication, as shown in Figure 5A. Only one phenotype, bone mineral density, deviates significantly from zero (Figure 5A). In this phenotype, replication was not explained well by either model., Replication analysis between OX and UC cohorts. (A) Difference between the observed and expected replication (y-axis) after accounting for Winner’s Curse (green) and after accounting for both Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding (brown). Empirically computed 95% confidence intervals are shown as vertical bars. (B) Variance attributable to study-specific heterogeneity and genetics. The phenotypes are sorted by the amount of variance explained by genetics. There are six phenotypes with at least as much variance explained by genetics as study-specific heterogeneity (EDL, tibia, BMD, total locomotor activity, TA, and locomotor activity initial) and three phenotypes where the heterogeneity is more substantial (soleus, gastroc, and locomotor activity end). Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1., Replication analysis between OX and UC cohorts. (A) Difference between the observed and expected replication (y-axis) after accounting for Winner’s Curse (green) and after accounting for both Winner’s Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding (brown).

The phenotypes are sorted by the amount of variance explained by genetics. There are six phenotypes with at least as much variance explained by genetics as study-specific heterogeneity (EDL, tibia, BMD, total locomotor activity, TA, and locomotor activity initial) and three phenotypes where the heterogeneity is more substantial (soleus, gastroc, and locomotor activity end). Phenotype names are defined in Supplementary Table S1., We estimated the relative contribution of WC and study-specific heterogeneity for each phenotype. Figure 5B shows that the relative contribution varies between phenotypes. Replication rate differences for EDLs depend almost entirely on WC while for soleus, gastroc, and locomotor activity end, confounds outweigh the contribution of WC. In general, behavioral phenotypes tended to have more heterogeneity than physiological phenotypes., We returned to the results of the mega-analysis to categorize the robustness of the findings, based on the results of our replication analysis. For each of the genome-wide significant QTLs in the OX, UC, and mega-analysis studies, we corrected the observed effect sizes for WC using Zhong and Prentice (2008). This method takes into account the significance threshold used to detect the QTLs. We estimated the power using this corrected effect size estimate (Supplementary Table S6). As expected, power was on average higher in the mega-analysis than the component studies (Supplementary Figure S11). We then used these power estimates in combination with replication data and estimates of study-specific heterogeneity to divide the mega-analysis results into four categories (Table 3).,  Example QTLs obtained in the mega-analysis, divided into four confidence categories, Phenotype names (“phenotype”) are defined in Supplementary Table S1. The chromosome and position of each QTL are shown in columns “chr” and “pos.” The effect size, standard error, and negative log P-values in the mega-analysis are shown in “mega beta,” “mega se,” and “mega log P,” respectively. Negative log P-values that exceed the genome-wide threshold are bolded. The estimated power in the mega-analysis is shown in “mega power.” The negative log P-values and estimated power for the OX and UC studies are shown in the following four columns. The “heterogeneity” column shows the level of heterogeneity observed for each phenotype (not locus-specific), which is the estimated fraction of variance in the GWAS study explained by heterogeneity. Bolded values correspond to phenotypes where the fraction of variance explained by heterogeneity was greater than the fraction of variance explained by genetics (NA indicates that heterogeneity could not be calculated). Categories (“category”) were determined from replication data, estimated level of heterogeneity and estimated power in the mega-analysis. Category 1 contains QTLs that were replicated in both the OX and UC cohorts. Category 2 contains QTLs that were replicated in at least one cohort. Category 3 contains variants with low estimated level of heterogeneity. Category 4 contains all other variants. The genes implicated by each of the QTLs are shown (“genes”). See full results in Supplementary Table S6.,  Example QTLs obtained in the mega-analysis, divided into four confidence categories, Phenotype names (“phenotype”) are defined in Supplementary Table S1. The chromosome and position of each QTL are shown in columns “chr” and “pos.” The effect size, standard error, and negative log P-values in the mega-analysis are shown in “mega beta,” “mega se,” and “mega log P,” respectively. Negative log P-values that exceed the genome-wide threshold are bolded. The estimated power in the mega-analysis is shown in “mega power.” The negative log P-values and estimated power for the OX and UC studies are shown in the following four columns. The “heterogeneity” column shows the level of heterogeneity observed for each phenotype (not locus-specific), which is the estimated fraction of variance in the GWAS study explained by heterogeneity. Bolded values correspond to phenotypes where the fraction of variance explained by heterogeneity was greater than the fraction of variance explained by genetics (NA indicates that heterogeneity could not be calculated). Categories (“category”) were determined from replication data, estimated level of heterogeneity and estimated power in the mega-analysis. Category 1 contains QTLs that were replicated in both the OX and UC cohorts. Category 2 contains QTLs that were replicated in at least one cohort. Category 3 contains variants with low estimated level of heterogeneity. Category 4 contains all other variants. The genes implicated by each of the QTLs are shown (“genes”). See full results in Supplementary Table S6., The first category consisted of a high confidence set of variants that were significant in the combined study and both component study. Eight of the 70 variants in four phenotypes were in this first category of variants. The second category consisted of variants that were significant in the combined study and at least one component study. Twenty-one of 70 variants in 12 phenotypes were in this second category of variants. The third category consisted of variants found in phenotypes without evidence of heterogeneity (excluding phenotypes without enough significant variants to determine the heterogeneity level). Fourteen of the 70 variants in five phenotypes fell in this category. Finally, the fourth category contained the remaining variants. Twenty-seven of the 70 variants in 12 phenotypes fell within this category. A summary of the QTLs found in each of the categories is shown in Supplementary Table S7., By combining phenotypes and genotypes from two independent laboratories, we identified 70 loci for 23 complex traits in a population of 3076 commercially available outbred mice. The large sample delivered a median QTL interval size of 1.1 Mb. Fine-mapping reduced the number of likely causal variants, with a median reduction in set size of 51%. For all traits analyzed our results are consistent with a polygenic architecture, in which the vast majority of causal variants likely lie in noncoding parts of the genome, and with the existence of a considerable degree of pleiotropy, a pattern commonly recognized from GWAS of human complex traits (Visscher et al. 2017). As well as indicating the genetic architecture of the traits, our findings cast some light on the biology of the phenotypes we have mapped, allowed us to examine factors contributing to replication, and hence to assess the robustness of our findings. We discuss these points below., To assess the robustness of our findings in the mega-analysis, we categorized QTLs by integrating replication data, heterogeneity estimates for each phenotype, and estimates of power in the mega-analysis. We use replication of findings in the OX and UC cohorts to determine the two highest confidence categories. Confidence category 1 consisted of QTLs that replicated in both cohorts. One example QTL in this category was associated with tibia length (chr12:83514944). Through fine-mapping and annotation of variants in the causal set, we implicated the Zfyve1 gene. This gene was also implicated by two other loci associated with gastroc (chr12:83517483) and TA (chr12:83514944) and is expressed highly in these tissues (Lionikas et al.2012, 2013). Zfyve1 is known to bind to Ptdins3P (Lee et al. 2019), which is an important mediator of Akt/PKB kinase activation and upregulation of protein synthesis (Hemmings and Restuccia 2012), providing a potential mechanism for influencing variability in muscle weight. Zfyve1’s link to Ptdins3P along with the GWAS associations with tibia length, gastroc weight and TA weight suggests that Zfyve1 may be involved in modification of the intracellular signal promoting growth., Confidence category 2 contained QTLs that replicated in one component study but not the other. These associations are less likely to be driven by differences between studies or Winner’s Curse, since they were also significant in a component study with fewer samples than the mega-analysis. For example, chr11:94758993 was associated with abnormal bone mineral density in the mega-analysis and was replicated in the OX study but not the UC study. Through our fine-mapping and nonsynonymous variant annotation, we implicated the gene Tmem92, which has been previously found to be associated with heel bone mineral density in humans in a number of studies (Kemp et al. 2017; Kim 2018; Kichaev et al. 2019; Morris et al. 2019). Additionally, the Tbx18 gene which was implicated by a confidence level 2 QTL for plantaris weight (chr9:87855594), was previously associated with body size phenotypes in human GWAS studies and mouse KO studies (Wu et al. 2013; Lotta et al. 2018; Kichaev et al. 2019; Pulit et al. 2019)., Confidence category 3 contains QTLs that did not replicate in component studies. However, these QTLs were found in phenotypes with relatively lower heterogeneity and had high estimated levels of power (>0.5) in the mega-analysis after correcting for Winner’s Curse. A QTL for EDL weight (chr13:113025220) in confidence category 3 implicated gene Cdc20b, which has been previously associated with BMI adjusted waist circumference in human GWAS (Zhu et al. 2020). The estimated power level for this variant was 11% in the OX study, 14% in the UC study, and 67% in the mega-analysis. QTLs in confidence level 3 are likely to be true associations that were identified due to the increase in power in the mega-analysis., In general, we observe that genes implicated using high confidence QTLs are more likely to have support in previously published results. For example, we identified seven olfactory receptor genes from two QTLs associated with EDL weight and body weight that were in the lowest category of confidence (4). Additionally, the EDL QTL (chr2:86662262) had low estimated power after correcting for Winner’s Curse, and the body weight QTL (chr17:37094289) had a high estimated level of heterogeneity between studies. None of the seven genes have been previously associated with related phenotypes in the literature and are unlikely to be true associations. However, there is evidence to support the candidacy of genes at some of the QTLs in this category. For example, a QTL for soleus weight (chr13:9242435) implicates Larp4b, which has been previously associated with atypical femoral fracture and ankle injury in human GWAS (Kim et al. 2017; Kharazmi et al. 2019). Since the soleus is the plantar flexor muscle of the ankle, it is likely to play a role in these two phenotypes. While we estimated substantial amounts of heterogeneity for the locomotor activity end phenotype and the soleus weight phenotype, previous findings may indicate that these genes may have been identified in spite of the heterogeneity we observed., While these examples highlight genes that have previously been associated with similar phenotypes in mice or humans, other genes (Pnpo, Gm11545, Psmb9, and Ttll6) represent novel targets for functional validation in follow-up studies. In particular, Pnpo lies at the bone mineral density QTL chr11:96912238, in confidence category 1. The bone mineral density phenotype had relatively low estimated levels of heterogeneity between the OX and UC cohorts, and the power of the mega-analysis after correcting for Winner’s Curse was close to 100%., Our results also provided us with an opportunity to identify the factors that contribute to replication rates. When we investigated replication between component studies we found that about a fifth (19%) of QTL discovered in OX replicated in UC and just less than one-third (32%) of QTL identified in UC replicated in OX. We explored reasons for the low rates of replication and came to the following conclusions., Unknown confounds between laboratories limited replication, but this depended on the phenotype. By applying a method that detects the effect of heterogeneity, we observed that for one phenotype there was no impact of heterogeneity (weight of the EDL muscle), while on others the impact was substantial (up to 60% of the variance explained in the case of weight of the plantaris muscle). Some of the differences likely reflect systematic differences between the way the mice were treated at the two testing sites: mice born in Portage, Michigan, were shipped either to Chicago by truck (∼200 km) or to Oxford by truck and plane (∼6100 km). Other factors may include differences in the way the animals were handled or a variety of other laboratory specific differences., Current human GWAS usually report results only from their meta-analyses, following the argument that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analyses (Skol et al. 2006), and rarely rely on replication as a touchstone for the dependability of their findings. Results obtained in this way are usually regarded as robust (Marigorta et al. 2018). However, replication rates may be inconsistent with the P-values and effect sizes reported in discovery cohorts; for example, a replication rate of 48% was found in a survey of 100 papers (Palmer and Pe'er 2017)., The bulk of human GWAS findings since 2008 are replications of associations that have been described at least twice (Marigorta et al. 2018), thus allaying concerns that the findings are not robust. The same cannot be said for mouse GWAS, where it is rare for a trait to be mapped multiple times at all, much less to be mapped multiple times in the same population. Furthermore, the genetic structure of mouse mapping populations is quite unlike that of outbred human populations. For example, no human population consists of fully inbred individuals, a commonly used design in mouse experiments [as in the recombinant inbred strains of the collaborative cross, or the inbred strains that constitute the hybrid mouse diversity panel (Flint and Eskin 2012)]. Replication across such different populations is more difficult than within a population [as already documented for human studies (Palmer and Pe'er 2017)]. We show here that obtaining robust results in mice is demanding because of difficulties in obtaining a replication population, the impact of Winner’s curse and phenotype specific confounds. As a first step we derive categories of confidence to our mapping results by combining information about replication, study-specific heterogeneity, and power. We thus categorized loci into one of four confidence levels. Our approach helps alleviate concerns about reproducibility (Button et al. 2013) and can be used to prioritize QTLs for follow-up studies, but needs further development to produce a systematic method to evaluate confidence quantitatively, rather than categorically as we have attempted here. This framework may also be applicable to human GWAS especially when replicating in admixed populations, when phenotyping may be difficult., The authors affirm that all data necessary for confirming the conclusions of the article are present within the article, figures, and tables.

To conclude, we believed our tool will facilitate future subcellular fractionation-related sequencing study to explore the function of RNA localization in various biological problems., RNA localization plays important functions in diverse biological processes in the cells. Proper subcellular distribution of RNAs not only maintains the correct organization of cell structure but also is crucial to control multiple biological processes (Holt and Bullock 2009; Medioni et al. 2012; Holt and Schuman 2013; Bovaird et al. 2018). mRNAs localized to specific compartments in the cells allow proteins to be produced rapidly and energy-efficiently on-site rather than be transported with lag and cost especially in response to extrinsic stimuli (Martin and Ephrussi 2009; Medioni et al. 2012). For noncoding RNA, since noncoding RNAs broadly involved in multisteps of gene expression control in distinct localizations in the cell, proper partitioning of regulatory RNAs would be critical to promote interaction with targets and ensure efficient execution of their biological functions (Batista and Chang 2013)., RNA localization involves multiple regulatory processes, such as RNA nuclear retention, cytosolic export, and transportation to specific compartments. Cis-elements encoded on RNAs are recognized by RBP and guide the RNA to the proper cellular localization of RNAs (Miyagawa et al. 2012; Chaudhuri et al. 2020). Many neuronal and oocyte mRNAs have extended 3’UTRs that contain the cis-elements dictating their specific localization pattern in the cells, which is referred to as RNA cis-acting zipcode elements (Jambhekar and Derisi 2007; Taliaferro et al. 2016; Tushev et al. 2018). However, cis-elements are not restricted to 3’ UTR but can be located at other exonic regions. For example, binding of HNRNPK to C-rich motifs outside Alu elements is associated with increased nuclear accumulation in both lncRNAs and mRNAs (Lubelsky and Ulitsky 2018)., Traditionally, RNA localization was studied on a gene-by-gene manner. Recently, the omics approaches were used to reveal the genome-wide localization patterns. A number of experimental approaches were available to perform genome-wide profiling for subcellular fractionations, such as subcellular RNA-Seq and CeFra-Seq (Djebali et al. 2012; Lefebvre et al. 2017). When performing the quantification and downstream analyses, most used relative localization ratios of separately normalized expression quantification (such TPM or FPKM values) without adjusting based on their absolute abundances in different fractions (Carlevaro-Fita and Johnson 2019). However, subcellular distribution of RNA molecules is asymmetric in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments: cytosol generally has a higher total RNA abundance than nucleus (Abdelmoez et al. 2018; Guo et al. 2020). A previous study adopted a multiple linear regression approach to estimate absolute abundances for lncRNA and mRNA in nuclear and cytosolic fractions separately (Carlevaro-Fita and Johnson 2019). Moreover, adopting relative and absolute ratios might yield different conclusions, thus suggesting the need to consider absolute ratios (Carlevaro-Fita and Johnson 2019). However, no available tool was provided for their method., In this study, we provided a method and easy-to-use Python scripts to infer the relative abundance of different subcellular fractionations. Instead of estimating the absolute ratios for lncRNA and mRNAs separately adopted in multi linear regression method, we estimated only one single fraction ratio. The relative abundance of different cellular fractions predicted based on our method was consistent with existing results. Then we explored whether such relative abundance varied in different conditions. In addition to global level regulation, we also looked into the distribution pattern for individual genes in these conditions. Finally, we tried to explore the regulatory mechanism and potential functional significance of the variations of RNA localization., The processed gene and transcript TPM expression level data of subcellular polyA and non-PolyA samples were downloaded from ENCODE database (https://www.encodeproject.org/). There are 11 cell lines with Cytosol, Nucleus and whole cell (WC) fractions PolyA RNA-seq, 7 cell lines with RNA-seq from three corresponding non-PolyA fractions (Tilgner et al. 2012). The detailed sample information could be found in Supplementary Table S1., The RNA-seq data about HNRNPK was downloaded from the SRA database, accession SRP111756 (Lubelsky and Ulitsky 2018). The sequenced reads were mapped to human reference genome (GRCh38.89) using the STAR (STAR_2.5.3a) mapping program with parameters recommended by ENCODE project (Dobin et al. 2013). The expression TPM and FPKM of genes and isoforms were calculated by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM v1.3.0; Li and Dewey 2011)., We’ve tested in multiple datasets and such cost function would normally yield a bell shape in the prediction error measurement (Figure 1). When dealing subcellular fractionation with more than two fractions, similar ratios for each fraction can be estimated simultaneously with the same function. The method is available as a standalone Python pipeline (github.com/bioliyezhang/SFAE)., Overview of pipeline. Cells are separated into cytosol and nucleus fractions, then Cytosol, Nucleus, and WC fractions are separately sequenced (left). With processed TPM data of three fractions, true CR could be calculated with SFAE as figure shows (right); E(θ) is defined as summed estimated error between predicted- and observed-TPM data of WC for all genes. For each CR or θ in this example, an Estimate Error between predicted- and observed-TPM data of WC was calculated. Then, the CR value with the minimum estimated error (red point) is considered to be optimal estimate of CR., Overview of pipeline.

Cell were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. HeLa cells were treated with 5 µg/ml actinomycin D (ActD; Merck) to inhibit transcription (Hou et al. 2019), DMSO was added as a control (5%), and then harvested at the indicated time points following addition of ActD., For separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, the extraction kit (Beyotime China, P0027) was used and followed the same procedures as previous study (Khan et al. 2021). Total RNA was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA by using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, then use RNaseH to degrade the RNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and dNTP. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 370–420 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA)., We extracted cDNA sequence of the most highly expressed isoform (defined by the isoform with the highest total sum of expression TPM values) across multiple cell lines for each gene in three genesets from ensemble reference database (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa; Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa). Then we used FIMO to scan each gene’s cDNA sequence for occurrences of the annotated motifs from CISBP-RNA and Ray 2013 motif databases from MEME website based on default setting (Grant et al. 2011). To remove the bias driven by gene length, we calculated the motif density (normalized by gene length) for each gene given a RBP motif. Then we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to examine whether the motif densities (motif occurrences divided by most abundant isoform length) were significantly different between genes in one geneset vs the rest of genes. Then P-values were then corrected for multiple hypotheses testing by FDR method., For genesets of mouse, we directly used the genesets (Cyto-gene and Nuc-gene) defined in their study (Halpern et al. 2015). Cytoplasmic genes (Cyto-genes) are genes whose log2(NumberCyto/NumberNuc) more than 0 in both MIN6 cells and liver cells (NumberCyto and NumberNuc respectively represent normalized numbers of cytoplasmic and nuclear mRNAs per cell in MIN6 cells and liver cells). Similarly, nuclear genes (Nuc-genes) are genes whose log2 (NumberCyto/NumberNuc) less than 0 in both MIN6 and liver cells., First, correlation between CR of each gene and max/second expressed transcript were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient. Second, the genes whose absolute correlations of the most and second-most abundantly expressed transcripts are both more than 0.4 and median TPM of genes are greater than 3 were chosen. Finally, 335 genes with opposite correlation pattern (positive and negative correlation) in two isoforms were remained., We used θi (ranges from 0 to 1) to represent the ratios of total RNA abundances among individual cellular subfractions. When cells are fractioned into nuclear and cytosolic portions, we used θcyto to represent the CR. For each fraction as well as total cell extract, we have a vector of transcripts per million (TPM) values (such as TPMCyto, TPMNuc, and TPMWC) to represent the expression vectors. We estimated optimal θCyto by minimizing the sum of log ratios of the observed and predicted expression matrix (Figure 1 and see more details in Materials and Methods section). Such strategies can be also generalized to cases with more than two subcellular fractionations of cells, such as data from CeFra-Seq with four fractions., We applied this method to quantify the relative cytosolic and nuclear portion for polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNA in the ENCODE datasets (Tilgner et al. 2012). As expected, majority of polyadenylated RNAs resided at cytosol, while nonadenylated RNAs did not show strong enrichment at cytosol (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1). CRs of polyadenylated RNAs in human cell lines from different tissues were tightly distributed between ∼70% and 90%. Similar results were obtained in non-ENCODE studies (control in Figure 2B). The multiple fractionation techniques (CeFra-Seq) yielded similar CR estimate (Supplementary Table S1; Benoit Bouvrette et al. 2018). Similar levels of CRs were observed in D17 cell line from fruit fly (Supplementary Table S1; Benoit Bouvrette et al. 2018). Such estimates of CRs are also consistent with results (∼84%) from one single-cell study on human K562 cell lines (Abdelmoez et al. 2018). In addition, a study on mouse cell line using RNA-Seq and RNA-FISH showed that most transcripts have a 3.8 cytoplasm/nucleus ratio (Halpern et al. 2015), which was also consistent with the ∼70–90% CR ratios. In summary, all these evidences suggested the CRs predicted based on our method were consistent with results from existing studies. And such CRs suggested that using relative ratios between nuclear and cytosolic RNAs might underestimate the genes with an absolute abundance level preference for cytoplasmic localization., Application of SFAE to estimate CRs in multiple conditions.

Median Log2-transformed Cyto/Nuc ratios for the all lncRNAs and mRNAs in each cell line are shown., To understand whether overall abundance ratios between nuclear and cytosolic RNAs can be regulated, we looked into the subcellular fractionation RNA-seq dataset where perturbation is available. We observed a consistent decrease (∼10%) in cytosolic RNA ratios upon HNRNPK knockdown in two cell lines (Figure 2B). The decrease in cytosolic RNA also agreed with a larger number of nuclear-enriched genes (397) vs cytosol-enriched genes (283) upon perturbation (Lubelsky and Ulitsky 2018)., Unfortunately, such dataset is quite limited. Since we did not have a positive-control treatment that is known to alter the cytosolic RNA ratios, we resorted to ActD treatment, which inhibits transcription. Originally, we suspected that such cytosolic ratios (CRs) might increase as nuclear transcription was shut down. Both ActD inhibition (Supplementary Figure S2A) and RNA subcellular separation (Supplementary Figure S2B) were successful. However, CRs actually decreased slightly (from 0.629 in DMSO to 0.575 in ActD treatment) based on SFAE. We suspected that RNA degradation might play crucial roles in such process. Therefore, we extracted the short and long half-lives RNA in Hela cells from previous study (Sharma et al. 2016). Indeed, RNA with short half-lives exhibited a much stronger decrease in expression levels (Supplementary Figure S2C). Consistently, the RNAs with shorter half-lives showed a significant decrease in CRs, but not the RNAs with long half-lives (Supplementary Figure S2D)., Therefore, both examples above serve as a proof-of-principle that global cytosol ratios can be altered; further studies are needed to characterize how common this global CR is regulated under other conditions and biological processes., As we obtained the correct estimates between the overall RNA abundances in cytosol and nucleus, we could calculate the absolute ratio between cytosol and nuclear localized mRNAs for each gene. We calculated such ratios for the polyadenylated mRNAs in ENCODE datasets, and clustered on both the gene and sample levels (Figure 2C). Consistently, majority of genes showed more enrichment in the cytosol vs nucleus. There were three major gene clusters based on K-means clustering algorithm, and the cluster in the bottom showed clear preference for nuclear localization pattern. As expected, nonprotein coding genes, such as lncRNA and antisense RNAs, were significantly enriched (P-value < 2.2e-16 based on a Chi-Square test) in this nuclear localized cluster (Figure 2D). Therefore, after adjusting with absolute CR ratio predicted by our method, the gene level localization patterns on the mRNAs (predominantly cytosol) and lncRNAs (predominantly nucleus) were also consistent with existing results (Chen and Carmichael 2009; Khalil et al. 2009; Derrien et al. 2012)., When focusing on the cell line specific patterns, we plotted the median log2 ratios between the absolute Cytosol vs Nuc TPM for mRNAs and lncRNAs as used in published literature (Figure 2E;Carlevaro-Fita and Johnson 2019). We also compared the results for 9 cell lines based on SFAE and multiple linear regression methods. Both methods predicted preferred localization in cytoplasm for mRNAs in all 9 cell lines. For lncRNAs, 5 out 9 cell lines showed consistent results (>50% of lncRNA located more in nucleus in HelaS3, IMR90, MCF7 cell lines, while >50% of lncRNA located more in the cytosol in SKNSH and HUVEC cell lines). For the other four cell lines (GM12878, HepG2, K562, and NHEK), SFAE predicted that >50% lncRNAs preferentially located in the nucleus, while multiple linear regression projected the opposite pattern (preference in cytoplasm). To eliminate potential bias caused by subtle differences in TPM and FPKM normalization method, we rerun the SFAE with FPKM as the expression input and obtained almost identical results (Supplementary Figure S3). We also calculated the error between predicted WC TPM and observed WC TPM by summing up the log ratios of all lncRNAs for two methods. They showed overall comparable levels of errors defined in Equation (1) (Supplementary Table S2). For the four cell lines showing inconsistent in overall pattern, two cell lines showed lower error in SFAE, while the other two cell lines showed lower errors in multiple regression based method. Thus, the error between estimated and observed WC TPM could not be used to determine which method is more accurate. The predicted output of SFAE was more consistent with prevalent view of nuclear localization of lncRNAs. However, lack of ground truth, we were unable to decide for sure which method yielded the correct estimates., Most of studies on localization focused on polyadenylated RNAs, we also examined whether the localization patterns were consistent between RNAs with different polyA tail statuses. We quantified the median ratios across multiple cell lines between cytosolic and nuclear polyadenylated and nonadenylated RNA for each gene. Genes fell into three major categories (Figure 3A), and we defined three groups as nuclear, cytosolic, and bivalent genesets. Genes in cytosolic and nuclear subgroups showed consistent localization patterns irrespective of poly-adenylation status of RNAs, while genes in the bivalent group switched localization preferences when poly-adenylation status of mRNA changed: transcripts with polyA tails preferentially localized in the cytosol, while transcripts without polyA tails in the nucleus., Three gene subgroups based on the distribution pattern of polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNAs. (A) Scatter plot indicating three major group genes with based on median log2(Cyto/Nuc) ratios of polyA and non-PolyA data of cell lines. Genes on top-right and bottom-left are defined as Cyto genes and Nuc genes, as they are enriched in cytosol or nucleus irrespective of polyA tail status. Genes on bottom-right are defined as bivalent genes, which show distinct pattern based on polyA tail status. (B) Bar chart shows the number of enriched RBP motifs in the three gene clusters.

(D) Boxplot shows the summed intron lengths per gene distribution of three gene clusters. (E) Table shows the number of enriched RBP motifs with same or different localization preferences between human and mouse. Bivalent enriched motifs were considered as cytosol enriched motifs in here., Previous studies suggested that cis-elements on RNA carried localization signals (Jambhekar and Derisi 2007; Bergalet and Lecuyer 2014; Chen 2016). Therefore, we extracted the Ensemble cDNA sequences for all genes and predicted the presence of annotated motifs recognized by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) (Ray et al. 2013). We identified the enriched motifs based on their motif densities in each geneset (see Materials and Methods for more details). Interestingly, compared with other two groups, genes in nucleus group only have a much smaller number of enriched RBP motifs (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table S3), suggesting that their transcripts might contain fewer cytosolic export cis-elements. RBM4, which is the most enriched RBP in the cytosolic genes, contains a C-terminal alanine-rich domain that potentially mediate RNA export (Lai et al. 2003). RNA export function of SRSF1, another top enriched RBP, is also supported by a few published literatures (Das and Krainer 2014; Khan et al. 2021). However, the functional roles of RBP in RNA localization, such as RNA export, were still very limited. Therefore, we were unable to confirm whether these enriched motifs we predicted for cytosolic genes are indeed functional cis-elements. Our study provided a prioritized list for mechanistic studies., However, the localization pattern of bivalent genes could not be simply explained by cis-elements. We argue there are at least two models to explain the distinct localization preference based on polyA tail status. One possibility is that for these genes, a tight quality control was implemented and only fully processed transcripts with polyA tail were exported. As previous studies reported that RNA export is coupled with RNA processing, such as RNA splicing (Luo and Reed 1999; Zhou et al. 2000). To validate such assumption, we quantified the ratio between reads from incompletely spliced transcripts (reads with fragments containing intron) vs reads from fully spliced transcripts (reads only containing exons) for all genes in nuclear and cytosol subcellular fractions. Indeed, such ratios in bivalent genes were significantly higher compared with other two types for nuclear RNAs in nonpolyadenylated RNAs (Figure 3C). Interestingly, similar pattern was also observed in the nuclear RNAs with polyA tails (Supplementary Figure S4A), but not in the cytosolic RNAs with or without polyA tails (Supplementary Figure S4, B and C). To understand whether the longer total intronic length in polyA-dependent group led to higher ratios of incomplete splicing, we quantified the total intronic length for each gene in three groups. Indeed, the total intron length in bivalent genes were significantly longer, which might lead to a slower processing rate and higher fraction of incompletely processed transcripts (Figure 3D). This suggested that significant higher proportion of nonpolyadenylated RNAs from bivalent genes may be immature transcripts and thus be retained in the nucleus until the completion of RNA splicing., Another alternative explanation is that both polyA and non-PolyA transcripts had similar localization preference. But cytosolic poly-adenylation altered the pattern (see cartoon model in Supplementary Figure S5). Indeed, only bivalent genes, but not cytosolic genes, showed strong enrichment with cytoplasmic polyadenylation related genes such as CPEB2-4 (Supplementary Table S3; Charlesworth et al. 2013)., To understand whether these RBP mediated localization are conserved between species, we also processed the subcellular fractionation data from mouse. Indeed, we observed highly consistent pattern of enrichment in the same subcellular fractionation (Figure 3E and Supplementary Table S4). For instance, CPEB motifs were enriched in cytosolic genes in both species. Conserved RBP mediated localization between species is consistent with that CPEBs are cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (Novoa et al. 2010; Charlesworth et al. 2013)., Only the average value across multiple cell lines were shown in Figure 3A, however, the distribution preference might differ for the same gene in different cell lines. Therefore, we quantified the variations in the form of maximum difference among all the cell lines and variance of the CR ratios. Nuclear genes showed the largest variations, while cytosolic genes showed least variations for polyadenylated RNAs (Figure 4A). Similar pattern was observed when the variances of CR ratios were plotted (Supplementary Figure S6A). Given general localization preference in the nucleus for lncRNA and cytosol for mRNAs, we quantified the variations of distribution for these two types of genes. Consistently, genes encoded mRNA showed significant lower variation in cellular distribution preferences (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S6B)., Variations of CR in multiple cell lines on the gene level.

Correlated and Not correlated, respectively, were defined based on whether genes showing and not showing significant positive Pearson correlation between mRNA and proteins from ovarian cancer CPTAC projects., Previous study showed that alternative isoforms exhibited different localization patterns (Taliaferro et al. 2016), therefore we wanted to evaluate whether alternative isoform splicing may explain the variations in localization in different conditions. We used RSEM to quantify the isoform level expression for all the genes. And we also calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the CRs values and isoform expression levels for all 11 cell lines. Then we looked for genes whose two highest expressed isoforms showed opposite correlation with CRs. In total, 335 genes with a relative high expression level (median TPM ≥ 3) showed such pattern (see one example on gene EPAS1 in Figure 4C and Supplementary Table S5). We examined the transcript categories for the exported (cytosolic) and retained (nuclear) isoforms based on their correlation with CR s. Indeed, the exported isoforms were significantly more enriched with protein-coding isoforms (P-value ≤ 9.42e-11 based on Fisher’s Exact test, Figure 4D)., Given the potential mechanism of regulating localization to control protein production, we suspected that the part of genes exhibited lower mRNA-protein correlation might adopt localization-based regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we extracted the genes showing and not showing significant positive correlation between mRNA and proteins from breast cancer and ovarian cancer in CPTAC projects (Edwards et al. 2015). Indeed, genes with strong mRNA-protein correlation showed significant lower levels of variations in term of CRs in both datasets (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure S6C), suggesting controlling mRNA export can be a general mechanism to regulate translation., Given the complexity to correctly estimate relative total transcript abundances in different cellular fractions, most of the existing studies adopted relative localization ratios for comparison (such as cytosol/nucleus ratios). Cyto/Nuc Ratios in polyadenylated RNAs predicted by our method showed clear imbalance between cytosolic and nuclear RNAs: there are consistently more RNAs resided in the cytoplasm compared with nuclear for all cell lines and conditions (Figure 2A). In addition, we showed that such Cyto/Nuc ratio could vary between different RNA subtypes, cell lines, or different conditions from the same cell line (Figure 2). The dynamic regulation of nuclear localization can occur on multiple levels. First, the global RNA abundance Cyto/Nuc ratio can change as we have observed in the HNRNPK knockdown and ActD treatment experiments. Interestingly, ActD treatment did not increase in CR upon transcription shutdown in the nucleus as expected, possibly due to the decrease of polyA mRNA in the cytosol caused by mRNA degradation was stronger than the decrease of polyA mRNA product",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on in the nucleus due to the transcription shutdown of ActD treatment (Tatosyan et al. 2020). It will be interesting to explore whether during disease states or developmental stages, such global nuclear/cytosol RNA ratio could be altered. If so, whether this regulation has functional consequences and its regulatory mechanism., We also showed that the localization pattern for each gene transcript could be dynamically regulated. For the genes exhibited large variations, we identified alternative isoforms that may exhibit distinct localization patterns. Therefore, by altering the relative abundance of different isoforms, the localization pattern can be switched. This is consistent with previous report that during neuronal differentiation, isoform switching occurs to regulate mRNA localization (Taliaferro et al. 2016). A cell-type-specific stability regulation might also explain the localization patterns for different isoforms in cell lines. Previous studies showed the stability of transcripts in different cell types or the same cell type in different conditions could be tuned in an isoform specific manner (Zhang et al. 2002; Tushev et al. 2018). Nevertheless, we suspected that localization regulation could be adopted to control translation. Consistently, the cytosol localizing isoforms were enriched with protein-coding isoforms (Figure 4D). In addition, we also observed that the genes with high mRNA-protein levels concordance from CPTAC datasets showed weaker variations in localization patterns (Figure 4E)., There are a number of possible regulatory mechanisms for RNA localization. By integrating analyses on non-PolyA and polyA RNAs, we identified a large polyA-dependent cytosolic geneset whose localization patterns differ based on polyadenylation tail status (Figure 3A). Previous studies showed the RNA export is frequently coupled with splicing and RNA maturation (Luo and Reed 1999; Zhou et al. 2000). Therefore, it is also possible that polyA tail just reflected the completion of RNA processing, which is coupled with RNA export. In addition, we identified the RBP motifs enriched with gene groups with distinct localization pattern. The motifs we identified were consistent with existing studies and also across species. We did observe that several RBP motifs showed opposite patterns in localization with respect to preference in nuclear or cytosolic fractions. A recent study showed that the difference in abundance of RBP protein levels, instead of cis-elements sequences on lncRNA, lead to opposite localization patterns between human and mouse embryonic stem cells (Guo et al. 2020). Due to the functional and structure conservation for the same RBPs, we suspected that the different regulation of abundance for these RBPs across species might be more likely cause for opposite localization patterns, instead of distinct localization patterns dictated by the homologous RBP genes in two closely related species. However, one limitation of our approach is that we relied on curated motif database, which might not truly reflect the true complexity of cis-elements that regulate the localization., The other limitation with our work is lack of enough biological replicates. Due to the small number of subcellular fractionation RNA-Seq, most of the sample we only have one or two biological replicates. Therefore, we are unable to dissect the variations caused by different cell lines and intrinsic variations within one cell line. On the global level, we did observe similar CR ratios for MCF7 and Hela cell lines generated from different labs (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1). It will be interesting to estimate the intrinsic variations of genes on RNA localization when no other biological variables were present, which will facilitate the identification of changes in localization caused by perturbations or different biological conditions (such as cell type) instead of intrinsic variations., In summary, we presented a SFAE method to estimate relative ratios for multiple subcellular fractions. By applying our methods, we were able to show the variations in RNA localization from multiple levels. Our results suggested that RNA localization could be dynamically regulated, therefore, it will be interesting to explore the functional consequences (such as the translational control) and significance of such regulated RNA localization in multiple physiological processes and disease conditions., The raw sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (Chen et al. 2021) in National Genomics Data Center (CNCB-NGDC Members and Partners 2021), China National Center for Bioinformation/Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GSA: HRA001427) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa., SFAE method is available as a standalone Python pipeline (github.com/bioliyezhang/SFAE)., Supplementary material is available at G3 online., The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments and suggestions for the manuscript.

These findings represent one of the first steps toward investigating Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination and demonstrate that the phenotype is a discrete response rather than a continuous one., Phenotypic plasticity is the phenomenon by which a single genotype may produce multiple phenotypes in response to variable environmental stimuli. Plasticity is pervasive in nature, affecting a range of phenotypes like morphology, development, behavior, and reproduction in bacteria, plants, and animals (Fusco and Minelli 2010; Forsman 2015; Fox et al. 2019). Meiotic recombination has also been shown to be phenotypically plastic, where the proportion of recombinant offspring increases in response to environmental stimuli. Plastic recombination has been observed in a number of taxa and in response to different stimuli: yeast experience elevated recombination rates under nutrient stress (Abdullah and Borts 2001), Arabidopsis displays recombination plasticity when exposed to extreme temperatures (Francis et al. 2007; Saini et al. 2017; Lloyd et al. 2018; Modliszewski et al. 2018), infection causes increased recombination in mosquitoes (Zilio et al. 2018) and plants (Chiriac et al. 2006; Andronic 2012), and social stress is associated with plastic recombination in male mice (Belyaev and Borodin 1982)., Plastic recombination also has a rich history of study in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Temperature was the first condition associated with plastic recombination in D. melanogaster, a phenomenon which has been well-characterized over the last century (Plough 1917, 1921; Stern 1926; Hayman and Parsons 1962; Grell 1978; Kohl and Singh 2018). Several other factors have been identified which induce plastic recombination in D. melanogaster, including maternal age (Bridges 1927; Priest et al. 2007; Hunter et al. 2016a), starvation (Neel 1941), heat shock (Zhong and Priest 2011; Jackson et al. 2015), and parasite infection (Singh et al. 2015)., More recently, infection with the bacteria Wolbachia pipientis has been associated with plastic recombination in D. melanogaster (Singh 2019). Wolbachia is a gram-negative endosymbiont that infects approximately 40% of terrestrial arthropod species including insects, spiders, and mites (Zug and Hammerstein 2012). Though Wolbachia is found throughout the somatic and germline tissues of its hosts (for review see Pietri et al. 2016), it is particularly abundant in germ cells and is maternally inherited through the oocyte (Dobson et al. 1999; Clark et al. 2002). Different Drosophila species are infected with unique strains of Wolbachia, each with varied effects on host biology (for review see Serbus et al. 2008; Werren et al. 2008; Correa and Ballard 2016; Kaur et al. 2021). One of the most well-studied Wolbachia-associated phenotypes is cytoplasmic incompatibility, which causes certain mating pairings between infected and uninfected flies to produce nonviable embryos (Turelli and Hoffmann 1995). Other strains of Wolbachia can cause phenotypes like male offspring killing or decreased lifespan in Drosophila (Hurst et al. 2000; Chrostek and Teixeira 2015). The native Wolbachia strain in D. melanogaster, wMel, has been shown to provide protection against viral pathogens (Hedges et al. 2008; Teixeira et al. 2008), increase host fecundity (Fry et al. 2004; Fast et al. 2011), and now is associated with plastic increases in recombination rate (Singh 2019; Bryant and Newton 2020)., Since Wolbachia’s role in plastic recombination is a recent discovery, there remains a large gap in our understanding of this interaction. One of the first papers to identify this phenomenon observed a correlation between Wolbachia infection and increased recombination across an interval of the X chromosome, but not on chromosome 3 (Hunter et al. 2016b). This finding was experimentally validated and expanded upon to demonstrate that Wolbachia’s effect on recombination was plastic and occurred in multiple strains of D. melanogaster (Singh 2019). Yet the scope, magnitude, and mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unclear., Of particular interest is the potential effect of magnitude in Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. Plastic phenotypes can often be described as either categorical, where the phenotype exists in discrete forms, or continuous, where the phenotype may display dose-dependency and scale with the magnitude of extrinsic or intrinsic factors (Scheiner and Levis 2021). Plastic recombination in D. melanogaster has displayed dose-dependency in response to temperature changes, where increased exposure time to heat shock continuously increased the magnitude of plastic recombination (Jackson et al. 2015). This raises an interesting question of how plastic recombination may be influenced by the strength of Wolbachia infection., An obvious candidate for testing this question of magnitude is the number of bacteria present within a cell, referred to as titer. Wolbachia-associated phenotypes can vary according to bacterial titer, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (Calvitti et al. 2015), lifespan reduction (Chrostek and Teixeira 2015), and viral pathogen protection (Chrostek et al. 2013; Ye et al. 2016). These phenotypes are considered dose-dependent because the strength of the phenotype continuously scales with the number of Wolbachia cells present within the host. However, some Wolbachia-associated phenotypes may display both categorical and continuous responses; at low bacterial titer, the phenotype exists in discrete forms which are not expressed until a certain Wolbachia titer has been reached, after which the response scales continuously with increasing bacterial titer. This has been observed in both male-killing (Hurst et al. 2000) and lifespan reduction (Reynolds et al. 2003), where the phenotypes display both discrete and continuous responses., If both plastic recombination and Wolbachia-associated phenotypes can display dose-dependency, this suggests that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination may also follow the same pattern. Recently, Bryant and Newton (2020) tested this by using flies infected with two Wolbachia strains that maintain different titers and found that flies infected with a higher titer of Wolbachia also had a higher recombination rate. Though these results are consistent with the idea that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination responds continuously to bacterial titer, it is difficult to determine since different Wolbachia strains were used. Because titer and Wolbachia strain were conflated, the distinct contributions of Wolbachia genotype and titer cannot be determined. Thus, additional research is needed to discern whether plastic recombination responds continuously to Wolbachia titer. It is also certainly possible that the response is continuous under some environmental conditions and discrete under others., To address this question, we tested the effect of Wolbachia titer on plastic recombination in D. melanogaster. We used host diet to manipulate Wolbachia titer in fly ovaries under control, yeast-enriched, and sucrose-enriched conditions to evaluate the effect of titer on plastic recombination. Recombination rate was measured using classic genetic approaches in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies across a genomic interval on the X chromosome. Our data recapitulate that Wolbachia infection is associated with increased recombination rate and find that diet-induced changes in titer had no effect on the magnitude of plastic recombination. These findings demonstrate that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination displays discrete phenotypes in response to diet-induced changes in Wolbachia titer in D. melanogaster., The D. melanogaster strain used in this experiment was RAL306, which comes from the Drosophila genetics reference panel (DGRP; Mackay et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2014). We used the RAL306 strain because it is naturally infected with Wolbachia and exhibits Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination (Hunter et al. 2016b; Singh 2019). To generate uninfected controls, we raised flies on tetracycline-containing media for two generations to remove Wolbachia. Tetracycline-containing media was created using standard cornmeal/molasses media mixed with ethanol-dissolved tetracycline at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml media (Holden et al. 1993). Following two generations of tetracycline treatment, flies were raised on standard media for over 10 generations to allow passive recolonization of the gut microbiome via the fly’s external microbiome., We used PCR to confirm Wolbachia infection status prior to the start of the experiment. Briefly, single females were collected from stock vials of Wolbachia-infected and uninfected RAL306 flies. DNA was extracted with a standard squish protocol (Gloor and Engels 1992) and used in PCR with primers for the Wolbachia gene, Wolbachia surface protein (wsp), to identify the presence of Wolbachia (Jeyaprakash and Hoy 2000; Singh 2019; Supplementary Table S1)., For both Wolbachia-infected and uninfected groups, F1 virgin females were raised on one of three diet treatments: control, yeast-enriched, or sucrose-enriched. After 3 days, males were added to diet treatment vials with virgin females for crossing. We set up 10 replicate vials for each experimental group in a single block, repeated for four total blocks (Supplementary Figure S1)., To produce the sucrose-enriched diets, we made a 40% sucrose mixture following Serbus et al. (2015). Initially, we crossed flies in pure sucrose-enriched vials, but larvae raised on sucrose media showed increased mortality and slower development (unpublished observations). Therefore, we devised a strategy to allow adult flies to feed on the sucrose-enriched media while also promoting normal larval development by using “sucrose patties.” Sucrose-enriched mixture was poured into vials and allowed to cool before being sliced into 1 cm patties, which were placed on top of control diet vials. This strategy allowed adult flies to feed on the sucrose-enriched media while larvae could burrow down to feed on control media after hatching., To make the yeast-enriched diets, we made a standard yeast paste by mixing dry active yeast and deionized water (Serbus et al. 2015). Approximately 2 ml of paste was added to control diet vials for the yeast-enriched treatments. Similar to the sucrose-enriched patties, this allowed adult flies to feed on yeast-enriched media while larvae could develop on control media., Since Wolbachia have been shown to increase recombination on the X chromosome (Singh 2019), we measured recombination with a standard two-step backcrossing scheme using the markers yellow (y) and vermillion (v) (33 centimorgans (cM) apart) (Figure 1). In the first cross, roughly 20 RAL306 females and 20 yv males were crossed in 8 oz bottles. Heterozygous F1 virgin female offspring were collected from these bottles. For the second cross, 5 F1 females were backcrossed to 5 yv males in a vial, with approximately 10 vials per diet treatment per block, repeated for a total of 4 blocks (Supplementary Figure S1). BC1 offspring (Figure 1) were counted to estimate recombination rate in F1 females by calculating the recombinant fraction (cM/100), which is the proportion of recombinant types to the total number of offspring. For these crosses, recombinant types were heterozygous (female BC1) or hemizygous (male BC1) for either the y or v allele (Figure 1)., A two-step crossing scheme to measure recombination. Recombination rate can be estimated on the X chromosome using the recessive visible markers yellow (y) and vermillion (v) (33 cM). Males with the y v markers are crossed to wildtype (+ +) females. Heterozygous F1 females are backcrossed to the same male strain to produce BC1 progeny. Progeny which display either the yellow or vermillion phenotype are considered recombinant. Male BC1 genotypes are not shown, but males are heterogametic and require only one copy of the yellow or vermillion marker to display a phenotype., A two-step crossing scheme to measure recombination. Recombination rate can be estimated on the X chromosome using the recessive visible markers yellow (y) and vermillion (v) (33 cM). Males with the y v markers are crossed to wildtype (+ +) females.

Male BC1 genotypes are not shown, but males are heterogametic and require only one copy of the yellow or vermillion marker to display a phenotype., All crosses were conducted at 25°C with a 12:12 h light: dark cycle. Virgins were age-matched at approximately 48 h before crossing. In each cross, flies were allowed to mate and lay eggs for 4 days before being removed., We collected and froze F1 females at −20°C after egg-laying for ovary dissections and DNA extraction. Flies from blocks 1–3 were dissected in 1x PBS for a total of 22 ovaries per experimental group. DNA was extracted from ovary samples using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following insect and Gram-negative bacteria protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted to amplify the Wolbachia gene, wsp, and estimate the average ovarian titer within each experimental group relative to two host genes, αTub84B and CG15365 (Supplementary Table S1). Each experimental group consisted of seven technical replicates for wsp and four technical replicates for each of the host genes, along with nontemplate controls to assess qPCR reaction efficacy. We used the SYBR Green Mastermix and standard manufacturer’s protocols for qPCR on a QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). We also estimated primer efficiencies using a 1:5 serial dilution standard curve with five dilutions using DNA extracted from Wolbachia-infected flies., Recombination rate between groups was compared using a logistic regression model to evaluate statistical significance of the effect of Wolbachia infection (⁠Wj⁠), diet (⁠Di⁠), or Wolbachia by diet interaction effects (⁠Di×Wj⁠). The full model is as follows, where Y refers to observed recombination data, μ refers to overall mean recombination rate, and ε refers to random variation: Yi,j=μ+Di+Wj+Di×Wj+ε⁠, (for i=1…3, j=1…2⁠). We used the statistical software JMP Pro (v16.0.0) for logistic regression modeling, using a general linear model with binomial distribution and link logit function., All other statistical analyses were carried out in RStudio (v1.2.5033). Mutant markers were tested for viability defects using G-tests for goodness of fit. A one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test were used to analyze differences in fly fecundity between experimental groups. A post-hoc analysis of recombination rate variance was conducted using a modified robust Brown-Forsythe Levene-type test and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For qPCR, raw Cq scores were analyzed using the Livak and Pfaffl methods (Livak and Schmittgen 2001; Pfaffl 2001) and differences between groups were tested using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The significance threshold for all statistical tests was set at 0.05., Power analyses for recombination rate comparisons were conducted using the R package “SIMR” to validate experimental results (Green and Macleod 2016). Simulated data were generated in R to produce a range of differences in mean recombination rate between groups, which were tested using repeated simulations in SIMR to calculate statistical power, where 80% power or greater is considered ideal., To assess the effect of Wolbachia titer on plastic recombination, we set up crosses for Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies on three diet treatments and measured recombination between the yellow and vermillion interval on the X chromosome. In total, 22,228 BC1 flies were scored for recombination (Table 1). For flies fed a control diet, the number of progeny per vial for Wolbachia-infected flies averaged 110 flies/vial, while uninfected flies averaged 111 flies/vial. On a sucrose-enriched diet, Wolbachia-infected flies produced an average of 117 flies/vial, compared to uninfected flies, which produced an average of 132 flies/vial. Finally, the number of progeny per vial for flies fed a yeast-enriched diet averaged 225 flies/vial, while uninfected flies averaged 208 flies/vial (Figure 2). Results from a one-way ANOVA test demonstrated that diet treatment [P < 2e−16, ANOVA (N = 150, df = 2)], but not Wolbachia infection [P = 0.942, ANOVA (N = 150, df = 1)] significantly affected fly fecundity. Further analysis with a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test found that the yeast-enriched diet increased fecundity significantly compared to the control (P < 1.3e−13) and sucrose diet treatments (P < 3.1e−14)., Fecundity, or number of offspring per vial, of experimental groups.

Statistically significant groups (P < 0.05) are denoted with an asterisk (*)., Offspring counts for experimental groups, Offspring counts for experimental groups, To determine whether the viability of the mutant markers affected the ratios of offspring phenotypes, we performed G-tests for goodness of fit within each vial for the following ratios: males versus females, wildtype (wt) flies versus yv flies, and yellow flies versus vermillion flies. The null hypothesis is a 1:1 ratio for all phenotypic classes compared. Significant deviations from expected ratios would indicate that the markers affected the viability of certain phenotype combinations, which would negatively impact recombination rate estimates., Similar to previous work (Hunter et al. 2016b; Singh 2019), we find small but nonsignificant viability defects associated with these markers. Out of 151 crosses, seven showed significant deviation with regards to the male-female ratio, 11 deviated from expected wildtype to yv ratios, and nine deviated from the expected ratio of yellow to vermillion flies. However, after using the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, only one of the deviant crosses remained significant (P = 1.14 E-12, G-test). This specific cross had a ratio of 9.8 wildtype flies to yv flies and a recombinant fraction of 0.05. This likely stems from mating contamination and we discarded this cross from further analyses., To compare Wolbachia titer between diet treatment groups, we ran qPCR with DNA extracted from frozen female F1 flies collected after egg-laying. Results are shown in Table 2, where gene expression of wsp relative to host genes in Wolbachia-infected flies was calculated using the Livak and Pfaffl methods (Livak and Schmittgen 2001; Pfaffl 2001). Analysis of qPCR data using either the Livak or Pfaffl method produced similar results, where flies fed a sucrose-enriched diet had the highest relative gene expression of wsp compared to control group flies and flies on the yeast-enriched diet (Table 2; Supplementary Figure S2). Since wsp expression is correlated with Wolbachia titer, this corresponds to a 3% increase in Wolbachia titer in flies on the sucrose diet treatment and a 23% decrease in Wolbachia titer in flies on the yeast diet treatment. Relative gene expression of wsp was significantly affected by diet treatment for both the Livak [P = 0.0019, ANOVA (N = 21, df = 2)] and Pfaffl analysis methods [P = 0.005, ANOVA (N = 21, df = 2)]. A Tukey’s multiple comparisons test indicated that Wolbachia titer was significantly reduced in the yeast-enriched diet treatment compared to flies in the control (P = 0.008 Livak, P = 0.018 Pfaffl) and sucrose-enriched diets (P = 0.003 Livak, P = 0.007 Pfaffl)., Relative gene expression of WSP in fly ovaries, P < 0.05, Tukey’s multiple comparisons., Relative gene expression of WSP in fly ovaries, P < 0.05, Tukey’s multiple comparisons., We used logistic regression modeling to identify variables which significantly contributed to differences in mean recombination rate between experimental groups. Results are shown in Table 3, where Wolbachia infection [P = 0.0008, X2 test (N = 150, df = 1)] and experimental block [P = 0.0001, X2 test (N = 150, df = 3)] were significantly associated with differences in recombination rate. We measured recombination rate across the y—v interval (33 cM) of the X chromosome, with an expected recombination rate of 30–35 cM. The effect of Wolbachia infection can be seen clearly in Figure 3, where Wolbachia-infected flies display an average recombination rate of 37.1 cM while uninfected flies display an average rate of 34.7 cM, resulting in an average increase of 2.4 cM in recombination rate across all diet treatments. Neither host diet [P = 0.42, X2 test (N = 150, df = 2)] nor infection by diet interaction effects [P = 0.43, X2 test (N = 150, df = 2)] was significant. Based on the power of our tests, we would have been able to detect a difference of 5.8% or greater between group means, which corresponds to a difference in recombination rate of approximately 2 cM (Supplementary Figure S3). This indicates that the effect of diet or Wolbachia titer, if present, was weaker than the effect of Wolbachia infection alone., Recombination rate, reported as recombinant fraction, of experimental groups. The recombinant fraction is the proportion of recombinant progeny compared to the total number of progeny produced for each cross, which is equivalent to cM divided by 100.

Statistical significance was tested using a general linear model, where Wolbachia and experimental block significantly affected recombination rate (P < 0.05), while diet and Wolbachia-diet interactions were not significant., Results of logistic regression modeling on recombinant fraction, P < 0.05, general linear model., Results of logistic regression modeling on recombinant fraction, P < 0.05, general linear model., Since the sucrose diet treatment did not significantly increase Wolbachia titer relative to the control diet, we performed additional logistic regression modeling on the control and yeast diet treatment groups. Wolbachia infection [P = 0.0001, X2 test (N = 99, df = 1)] and experimental block [P = 0.038, X2 test (N = 99, df = 3)] were significantly associated with recombination rate differences, while host diet [P = 0.26, X2 test (N = 99, df = 1)] and infection by diet interaction effects [P = 0.97, X2 test (N = 99, df = 1)] were not significant (Supplementary Table S2)., We also tested for the effect of Wolbachia infection, titer, and diet on recombination rate variance, which was calculated as absolute residuals. Uninfected flies showed no significant difference in recombination rate variance between diet treatment groups [P = 0.25, Levene’s test (N = 75, df = 2)], and a comparison between uninfected and Wolbachia-infected flies was also nonsignificant [P = 0.11, Levene’s test (N = 150, df = 1)]. However, Wolbachia-infected flies displayed significant differences in variance between diet treatment groups [P = 0.007, Levene’s test (N = 75, df = 2)] and a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test found that infected flies on a sucrose-enriched diet were significantly different from flies on a control (P = 0.03) and yeast-enriched diet (P = 0.003)., The goal of this experiment was to assess whether Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination in D. melanogaster is continuous or discrete in response to changes in bacterial titer. Wolbachia cannot currently be transgenically modified, making it impossible to use genetic engineering to test for differences in titer. Several other factors have been shown to alter Wolbachia titer, including temperature (Hurst et al. 2000; Moghadam et al. 2018), bacterial genotype (Chrostek and Teixeira 2015), and host diet (Serbus et al. 2015). However, both temperature (e.g., Plough 1917; Grell 1978; Jackson et al. 2015) and bacterial genotype (Singh et al. 2015; Bryant and Newton 2020) also affect recombination rate in D. melanogaster. Host diet can alter Wolbachia titer within fly ovaries, specifically that a yeast-enriched diet decreases titer while a sucrose-enriched diet increases titer (Serbus et al. 2015; Camacho et al. 2017; Christensen et al. 2019). Therefore, we used host diet to manipulate Wolbachia titer and tested the effects of Wolbachia infection, host diet, and Wolbachia titer on recombination rate. We find that Wolbachia infection is associated with a significant increase in recombination rate across the y—v interval on the X chromosome (Table 3). Our data indicate that the Wolbachia-associated increase in recombination is robust with regards to variation in host diet, as Wolbachia-infected flies displayed a higher recombination rate than their uninfected counterparts in each diet treatment (Figure 3). This finding adds to a growing body of literature which supports Wolbachia as an inducer of plastic recombination in D. melanogaster (Hunter et al. 2016b; Singh 2019; Bryant and Newton 2020)., Since we used host diet to manipulate Wolbachia titer, we also assessed whether diet treatments had an impact on plastic recombination. We find that our diet treatments did not significantly affect recombination rate in Wolbachia-uninfected flies (Table 3, Figure 3). The effect of diet on plastic recombination in flies has been severely understudied, where one previous study reported that starvation in larvae was associated with increased recombination rate (Neel 1941). Differences between our study and the previous one may indicate that only severe changes in diet such as starvation are sufficient to induce plastic recombination in D. melanogaster. However, it should also be noted that Neel’s study was carried out using markers on chromosome 3 (1941) while our study assessed recombination on the X chromosome. This may suggest that diet-associated plastic recombination is variable across the genome, as is the case for other conditions associated with plastic recombination such as temperature and Wolbachia infection (Grell 1978; Singh 2019). Outside of the present study, no recent investigations have been made into how starvation or diet affects recombination in flies, highlighting a need for additional research into the role diet may play in plastic recombination. Our study only uses three diet treatments, while a more rigorous investigation of the effects of varying levels of carbohydrates, proteins, and caloric content is needed to definitively assess the effect of diet on plastic recombination in flies., Though our diet treatments did not affect recombination rate, there was an effect of diet on fecundity. We observed that the average number of offspring per vial was significantly different between diet treatments, with yeast-fed flies displaying the highest average fecundity (Figure 2). The influence of diet on lifespan and fecundity in D. melanogaster has been well-characterized, especially regarding sucrose and yeast content (Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling 2001; Bass et al. 2007). Specifically concerning fecundity, yeast-enriched diets greatly increase female fecundity, while sucrose-enriched diets decrease female fecundity (Bass et al. 2007)., Wolbachia are often associated with increased fecundity in host fly species (Weeks et al. 2007; Mazzetto et al. 2015; Singh 2019), yet we found no significant effect of Wolbachia infection on fecundity. However, this may reflect a strain-specific response, rather than the effect of Wolbachia infection on D. melanogaster as a whole. Differences in fly fecundity depend on Wolbachia genotype (Gruntenko et al. 2019), host genotype (Fry et al. 2004), and bacterial-host interactions (Singh 2019). For instance, the strain used in this experiment, RAL306, was also used in a study which reported an overall effect of Wolbachia infection on fecundity across multiple strains (Singh 2019). However, when examined individually, Wolbachia-infected RAL306 flies had a lower mean fecundity than uninfected RAL306 flies (Singh 2019). This suggests that Wolbachia broadly impacts fecundity, but this effect may vary with host genotype., By using host diet to manipulate Wolbachia titer, we tested the effect of titer on the magnitude of Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. We measured wsp gene expression relative to host genes to measure Wolbachia titer in infected fly ovaries for each diet treatment group. Our results agree with other studies which find that yeast-enriched diets decrease Wolbachia titer and sucrose-enriched diets increase Wolbachia titer in fly ovaries (Table 2; Serbus et al. 2015; Christensen et al. 2019). Our yeast diet treatment had a much stronger effect on Wolbachia titer than our sucrose diet treatment, resulting in a 23% ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ecrease in titer compared to control flies, while flies on a sucrose diet showed a 3% increase in titer compared to control flies., Combined with the recombination analysis which found no effect of infection by diet interactions (Table 3), these results suggest that changes in Wolbachia titer did not induce a continuous response in plastic recombination. This is, perhaps, not surprising in the case of the sucrose diet treatment, since a small increase in Wolbachia titer may not be enough to significantly affect the host fly’s biological processes. However, reanalysis of the data using only the control and yeast diet treatment groups still finds that Wolbachia infection significantly impacted recombination rate, but Wolbachia titer did not (Supplementary Table S2). So, while the yeast diet treatment significantly decreased Wolbachia titer, this decrease did not lower recombination rate relative to Wolbachia-infected control flies, yet still resulted in an increase in recombination rate relative to uninfected flies. These results provide us with several new pieces of information about Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination, which are discussed in more detail below., Though Wolbachia titer did not affect the magnitude of recombination, it did influence recombination rate variance. Wolbachia-infected flies fed a sucrose-enriched diet, to promote high Wolbachia titer, had significantly greater variance than Wolbachia-infected flies on either a control or yeast-enriched diet. This finding suggests that increased Wolbachia titer may increase recombination rate variation, rather than increase the average rate of recombination beyond that caused by standard Wolbachia infection. Changes in variance have not previously been reported for other inducers of plastic recombination in D. melanogaster, nor for other Wolbachia-associated host phenotypes, suggesting that this may be a unique feature of Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. This finding inspires multiple questions for future research, including why low Wolbachia titer did not result in decreased variance and whether this phenomenon is robust in response to other modifiers of Wolbachia titer., Based on our results, there are several new pieces of information we can conclude about Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. First, the phenotype must require relatively large changes in bacterial titer to elicit a corresponding change in response. Neither the sucrose diet treatment group nor the yeast diet treatment group significantly affected recombination rate relative to controls. This suggests that changes in titer need to be more dramatic than what we observed (3%–23%) to potentially affect recombination rates. It is possible that these changes in Wolbachia titer caused small, nonsignificant changes in recombination rate; if so, these changes are smaller than the effect of Wolbachia infection alone. This suggests that this phenotype displays discrete rather than continuous responses, where large changes in Wolbachia titer are required to cause the magnitude of plastic recombination to increase. It is also interesting that the yeast diet treatment decreased Wolbachia titer, but not enough to eliminate the Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination phenotype. Logic would suggest that there must be some minimum threshold of bacteria below which plastic recombination would not be induced in flies, but we did not reach that minimum in this experiment. Future work exploring even lower ranges in Wolbachia titer may be able to locate this threshold level., If Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination displays discrete phenotypic responses, this follows the same trend as male-killing, another Wolbachia-driven trait in Drosophila. In D. bifasciata, Wolbachia infection causes increased mortality of male offspring, leading to modified sex ratios (Hurst et al. 2000). However, Wolbachia titer decreases in flies exposed to elevated temperatures, which causes male mortality rates to decrease and offspring sex ratios to return to normal (Hurst et al. 2000). These findings suggested that this phenotype requires a threshold level of Wolbachia to be expressed and displays discrete responses at low titers and continuous responses at high titers. The same may be true for Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination, where recombination is modified in discrete amounts in infected flies. It may also be true that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination is continuous and dose-dependent, but only at titer levels more extreme than could be achieved through manipulations in host diet., Another study looked at the effect of bacterial titer on plastic recombination using different strains of Wolbachia (Bryant and Newton 2020). They find that D. melanogaster infected with the Wolbachia strain wMelPop display a higher recombination rate across the yellow-vermillion interval of the X chromosome when compared to flies infected with a different Wolbachia strain, wMel (Bryant and Newton 2020). The wMelPop strain maintains a much higher titer in flies, which could suggest that the magnitude of recombination corresponded with Wolbachia titer and indicates a dose-dependent relationship. Yet, as noted above, this study cannot separate the effect of titer from Wolbachia strain since two different strains were used in the experiment. Though wMel is the native Wolbachia strain in D. melanogaster, wMelPop is considered pathogenic because it maintains a high titer and significantly decreases host lifespan (Strunov et al. 2013; Chrostek and Teixeira 2015). Other pathogenic bacteria have been shown to plastically increase recombination rate in D. melanogaster (Singh et al. 2015), making it difficult to say whether an increase in recombination rate in wMelPop-infected flies is due to bacterial titer, its pathogenic nature, additional genetic differences between the two bacterial strains, or a combination of factors., Our data are consistent with the plastic recombinational response to Wolbachia infection being discrete, with even low bacterial titers inducing the response. It is certainly possible that larger changes in Wolbachia titer can induce different magnitudes of plastic recombination in the host. Future experiments which test a large range of Wolbachia titers are necessary to fully understand the nature of titer effects on Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination., It may also be true that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination is continuous and dose-dependent, but that this effect is masked in our study due to complex interactions between diet, host, and the microbiome. Diet is known to have a significant impact on microbiome composition in several species (Turnbaugh et al. 2008; Read and Holmes 2017; Erkosar et al. 2018). In D. melanogaster, diets rich in either yeast or sucrose caused significant changes in abundance of certain members of the gut microbiome (Chandler et al. 2011). These changes in microbiome composition can have drastic impacts on host biology including hormone production, metabolism, and nutrient acquisition (Leulier et al. 2017). Specific members of the D. melanogaster microbiome have been shown to support larval feeding under starvation conditions (Consuegra et al. 2020), suggesting that diet-induced changes in the microbiome can significantly impact host development. Though our results suggest that diet had no significant effect on recombination rate, as uninfected flies showed similar mean recombination rate for each diet treatment (Figure 3), it is difficult to rule out without directly measuring changes in microbiome composition., In addition to the gut microbiome, which comes in direct contact with nutritional elements, host diet also affects Wolbachia. One finding our study takes advantage of is that increased sucrose or yeast in D. melanogaster diets can manipulate Wolbachia titer (Serbus et al. 2015). Wolbachia rely on their host to acquire nutrients, so changes in diet can affect microbe behavior and replication and may ultimately impact host biology. Yeast diets have been shown to affect Wolbachia cell physiology, which could influence the growth and behavior of the bacteria (Serbus et al. 2015). However, Wolbachia in flies fed the yeast diet treatment still produced the same increase in recombination rate as control flies, suggesting that changes in cell physiology did not impact plastic recombination. In addition, Wolbachia-infected D. melanogaster have been shown to alter behavior and diet preference, potentially as a strategy to reduce negative effects on lifespan and fecundity (Ponton et al. 2015; Truitt et al. 2018). Though flies may alter their behavior under these conditions, Wolbachia have been shown to have no effect on emergence time or host nutrition under starvation conditions (Harcombe and Hoffmann 2004). We saw no significant differences in fecundity or viability related to infection status in this study, but it is unclear whether Wolbachia-infected flies fed experimental diets experienced changes in behavior that may have impacted recombination estimates., Finally, the gut microbiome and Wolbachia have been shown to influence one another. Wolbachia infection can alter relative abundances of members of the gut microbiome compared to uninfected flies (Simhadri et al. 2017). Conversely, ingestion of certain species of gut bacteria has been shown to influence Wolbachia abundance (Rudman et al. 2019). Taken together, these findings present a complex web of interactions between host, diet, the gut microbiome, and Wolbachia. Though it is difficult to estimate the impact of these interactions on our results, it remains clear that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination is robust in response to both measured changes in diet and unmeasured changes in microbiome composition. Future work may focus on studying Wolbachia-only experimental flies, where germ-free flies are reinfected with Wolbachia, to remove potentially confounding variables caused by these complex interactions. However, there is also value in studying these systems in their natural state in order to gain a more complete understanding of native host-microbe associations., Our current inability to transgenically modify Wolbachia makes it impossible to assess the effect of titer alone on Wolbachia-associated phenotypes. Though differences in titer can be assessed through manipulation of host diet (Serbus et al. 2015), temperature (Hurst et al. 2000; Moghadam et al. 2018), or Wolbachia strain (Chrostek and Teixeira 2015), these methods include confounding variables which make it difficult to definitively assign Wolbachia titer as the causative agent in phenotypes of interest. Our present study controls for host and microbe genotype and finds that Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination is a phenotype with discrete responses, while acknowledging the ways in which changes in host diet may influence that finding. Future advances toward making genetic manipulation possible in Wolbachia would allow the role of titer to be more definitively tested without confounding effects., Fly strains are available upon request.

These results point to conserved pathways and multiple mechanisms by which inhibition of Loxl2 can be beneficial to heart health and organismal aging., Molecular aging clocks use transcriptomics (Mamoshina et al. 2018; González-Velasco et al. 2020), proteomics (Lehallier et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2020), and epigenetic markers (Horvath 2013; Bergsma and Rogaeva 2020; Galkin et al. 2021) to predict a subject’s age with high accuracy. In addition, studies examining the transcriptomes and proteomes during aging have shown that the majority of genes change their expression trends (transcriptome trajectory turning points) between ages 20 and 40 in multiple tissues (Somel et al. 2010; Skene et al. 2017; Lehallier et al. 2019). The age range of these expression turning points corresponds to the time at which most adults will begin to visibly detect aging phenotypes ranging from skin wrinkles to graying hair (Albert et al. 2007; Panhard et al. 2012). We, therefore, hypothesized that a number of the molecules having turning points in this age range should present in aging clock data, and play a role in aging or age-related phenotypes., Through the examination of aging clocks (Horvath 2013; Lehallier et al. 2019) and transcriptome trajectory turning points (Skene et al. 2017), we identified Lysyl oxidase like 2 (Loxl2). Lysyl oxidases oxidatively deaminate lysine and hydroxylysine residues forming aldehydes on collagens which can then covalently bond, cross-linking the collagens and forming fibers (de Jong et al. 2011; Erasmus et al. 2020). Collagen is not only the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix (Frantz et al. 2010), but when excessive fibrillar collagen accumulates in the heart it is recognized as cardiac fibrosis (Manabe et al. 2002) and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia is frequently dependent on collagen texture (de Jong et al. 2011)., Loxl2 also binds transcription factors in the nucleus to inhibit and promote the transcription of genes that play a role in age-related diseases ranging from cancers to cardiovascular diseases (Wen et al. 2020). In human cells, Loxl2 binds the snail transcription factor to regulate E-Cadherin 1 (CDH1) expression (Peinado et al. 2005), and it has been demonstrated in flies that E-cadherin is dependent on the snail1 homolog escargot (esg; Tanaka-Matakatsu et al. 1996). Cadherins, Snail1, and LOXL2 are major components in the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT; Cuevas et al. 2014) and EMT is a key modulator of age-related diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease (Brabletz et al. 2018; Santos et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020). Further linking Loxl2, cadherins, and collagen is the observation that the EMT program is highly correlated with epigenetic regulation that remodels the ECM. (Peixoto 2019). We therefore aimed to examine the multifaceted role of Loxl2 in aging and aging phenotypes using Drosophila melanogaster., All assays were performed in females unless noted. Fly lines are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Flies were maintained at 25°, 60% relative humidity, and 12-h light/dark cycle in vials containing 25 adults. Larvae were reared on a standard cornmeal and yeast-based diet. The standard cornmeal diet consists of the following master mix of materials pumped into vials: water (1700 ml), agar (15.8 g), yeast (50 g), Cornmeal (104 g), sugar (220 g), TEGOSEPT (4.76 g), and 95% EtOH (18.4 ml). Five-day old adults received standard food with either RU486 mifepristone in 95% ethanol to induce RNAi (200 µM) or 95% ethanol in control food. Food vials were exchanged every 2–3 days. Calculations and chart were generated using Log Rank Mantel Cox test and JMP statistical discovery software. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7.03., Semi-intact Drosophila adult fly hearts were dissected and imaged in oxygenated artificial hemolymph according to previously described protocols (Fink et al. 2009).

Heart recordings were performed at 100 frames per second for 30 s on each fly using HCImage software (Hamamatsu Corporation), Hamamatsu digital camera C11440, Olympus BX51WI microscope, at 10× magnification. Arrhythmia index was calculated using the standard deviation of heart periods (time between diastoles)/median period using Semi-automated Optical Heartbeat Analysis (SOHA) software (Fink et al. 2009)., Fly abdomens were dissected in 1× PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in 0.3% 1× Phosphate-buffered saline plus Triton X-100 (PBST) for 20–30 min. Samples were washed in PBST, blocked with PBST plus Donkey or Goat Serum Albumin for 1 h, and then washed in PBST three times for 10 min each. The samples were incubated with anti-Pericardin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank # EC11) at 2 μg/ml overnight at 4°C, washed in PBST three times for 10 min each, then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch # 115-585-166) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed in PBST three times for 10 min each. Hoechst (Immunochemistry Technologies # 639) and Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher scientific # 12379) were applied for 30 min followed by washing in 1× PBS and mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen # P36961) according to manufacturer’s protocols., Images were taken on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. Filament widths were quantified with CellSens Software version 2.2. Images finalized using ImageJ Fiji v1.53c., Protein from 10 flies per replicate was extracted using TissueLyser II (Qiagen), Pierce IP lysis buffer, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and Phenylmethanesulfonyl Fluoride. Protein was quantified using Bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher # 23225) on a Biotek Epoch 2 microplate spectrophotometer. Protein was denatured in 2-Mercaptoethanol and 2× Laemmli sample buffer at 95° for 5 min and loaded onto 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories # 4561093) then rapid transfer to Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio Rad # 1620177). Membranes were blocked in 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 1× Tris-Buffered Saline plus Tween (TBST) for 1 h. Pericardin antibody at 0.2 μg/ml (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank# EC11) or B-tubulin at 0.2 μg/ml (DSBH # E7) were applied in 5% BSA at 4° overnight then washed in TBST four times for 5 min. Secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Jackson ImmunoResearch # 115-035-174) or anti-rabbit HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch # 711-035-152) were applied at 1:5000 in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature then washed in TBST four times for 5 min. Super Signal West Pico Plus Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific # 34577) was applied and then imaged with Bio-Rad Chemidoc.

Band intensity ratios were calculated using BioRad Image Lab 6.1., RNA from 10 flies per replicate was extracted using TissueLyser II (Qiagen), Trizol, chloroform, and isopropanol, then washed in RNAse free ethanol. DNase treatment (Turbo DNA-free, Ambion # AM1907) was performed following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was quantified using Thermo Scientific Nanodrop Lite Spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized using qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Bio # 95047-100) on the Applied Biosystems ProFlex PCR System. qPCR was performed using primers found in Supplementary Table S2 and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher # A25742) on Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3. Expression was calculated relative to Ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32)., We first compared the list of genes that make up the Horvath methylation epigenetic aging clock (Horvath 2013) with a blood plasma proteomic clock (Lehallier et al. 2019). We next selected genes that have transcriptome trajectory turning points occurring between ages 19 and 41 in the brain (Skene et al. 2017; Figure 1A). These ages were selected because the majority of transcriptome trajectory turning points, and an end of key developmental timepoints, occur within this window (Somel et al. 2010; Skene et al. 2017). Only five genes were found to overlap between the brain turning points, plasma proteomic clock, and the methylation clock; Target Of Myb1 Like 1 Membrane Trafficking Protein (TOM1L1), Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1), Loxl2, Glyoxalase I (GLO1), and CXADR Ig-Like Cell Adhesion Molecule (CXADR; Figure 1B)., Overlapping genes in aging clocks.

The five genes are the outermost nodes., Although at first glance these seem relatively unrelated, however, a gene network of the five genes in a STRING-db analysis suggests that the five genes may function around a TNF/WNT3A axis (Figure 1C). The genes are also target genes of the CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1 transcription factor (Rouillard et al. 2016), possibly indicating a common regulatory axis., We employed the model organism D. melanogaster due to its short lifespan and extensively available genetic toolkits to examine the age-related effects of these genes. We used Flybase (Larkin et al. 2021) to identify Drosophila genes with the highest ortholog scores for these five human genes (Figure 1B). Human CXADR had low homology with Drosophila proteins and was excluded from further study., To determine if the four genes may be relevant to Drosophila aging, UAS RNAi fly lines for the candidate genes were crossed with whole body daughterless-GeneSwitch GAL4 (da(GS)-GAL4) lines. RNAi was initiated by RU486 (mifepristone) chemical feeding in food starting on day five post-eclosion (to avoid impacting development) and continued until death. RNAi of Loxl2, fz3, and Glo1 significantly affected lifespan of female flies while CG3529 (TOM1L1 homolog) did not (Figure 2, A–D). Mean lifespan increased in the three fly lines by 3.7%, 6.4%, and 9.1%, respectively (Figure 2E)., Loxl2, fz3, and Glo1 reduction affects lifespan. (A–D) Lifespan assays for UAS RNAi of Glo1, Loxl2, fz3, and CG3529 fly lines crossed with whole body da(GS)-GAL4 lines.

We, therefore, examined the effect of Loxl2 on Drosophila collagen IV; Pericardin. Pericardin (prc) levels and filament width have been shown to increase with age, and reducing collagen-interacting protein SPARC increases lifespan while its overexpression increases arrhythmicity (Vaughan et al. 2018). We immuno-stained for Pericardin (Figure 3, A–D) and measured Pericardin filament width in alary muscles near the heart tube (Figure 3, E–H). Quantification revealed that filament widths increased with age and RNAi for Loxl2 significantly reduced this effect (Figure 3I). Western blots against Pericardin were then performed to determine if the filament width may be a result of changing Pericardin levels (Figure 3J, Supplementary Figure S1), but no significant difference of Pericardin levels between age matched +/−RU fed lines was seen (Figure 3K)., Loxl2 RNAi reduces Pericardin filament width with age.

Critically, Loxl2 maintains transcriptional regulation of genes that play a role in age-related diseases including cancers and cardiovascular disease genes (Wen et al. 2020). These genes include Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) [eiger; egr] (Schumacher and Prasad 2018; Rolski and Błyszczuk 2020), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1; Duan et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019), Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) [PDGF- and VEGF-related factor 1; Pvf-1] (Taimeh et al. 2013; Braile et al. 2020), NOTCH1 (Garg et al. 2005), and Cadherin 1; CDH1 [Cadherin-N2; CadN2] (Vite and Radice 2014; Mayosi et al. 2017; Turkowski et al. 2017); Drosophila homologs in square brackets (Larkin et al. 2021). We therefore asked if these genes have differential expression under Loxl2 RNAi with age (Figure 4, A–E). We found that CadN2 expression significantly increased at three and seven weeks under Loxl2 RNAi (Figure 4A)., Expression of Loxl2 regulated genes from human age-related disorders.

Unpaired t-test *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, *** P ≤ 0.001, **** P ≤ 0.0001, ns, not significant., Cadherins play a key role in cell matching during Drosophila heart development (Zhang et al. 2018). CadN2 is an underexplored protein in Drosophila and is the best matched ortholog to 17 Cadherins in humans (Larkin et al. 2021), of which three—CDH2 (Vite and Radice 2014; Mayosi et al. 2017; Turkowski et al. 2017), CDH5 (Bouwens et al. 2020), and CDH13 (Teng et al. 2015; Verweij et al. 2017)—play a role in, or correlate with, cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, Loxl2 has been implicated in collagen-related cardiovascular fibrosis, in particular, its reduction can reduce not only cardiac fibrosis (Yang et al. 2016) but also vascular stiffening (Steppan et al. 2019) with age in mammals., To test if Loxl2 reduction could affect the Drosophila heart we made use of the SOHA software (Ocorr et al. 2009), to measure cardiac arrhythmia indices; which can be used as measures of heart health and cardiac aging (Ocorr et al. 2007). SOHA on crosses of UAS-Loxl2 RNAi flies with whole body daughterless-GeneSwitch GAL4 (da(GS)-GAL4) and RU486 feeding starting on day five revealed that the arrythmia indices of knockdown flies significantly improved vs. controls at aged timepoints (Figure 5A)., Loxl2 RNAi positively affects the heart with age.

Log Rank Mantel Cox test *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001, ns, not significant., Due of the benefit of Loxl2 RNAi on the heart, we employed a Hand-GeneSwitch GAL4 (Hand(GS)-GAL4) heart-specific driver cross with UAS-Loxl2 RNAi to test if the lifespan benefits may be partially derived from heart Loxl2. We saw a significant mean lifespan benefit in both male and female flies (Figure 5, B and C)., This work is the first to demonstrate that the reduction of Loxl2 has a protective mechanism in the Drosophila heart and extends mean lifespan, consistent with Loxl2’s role in mammalian cardiovascular disease (Yang et al. 2016; Steppan et al. 2019). We also show inhibiting Loxl2 can reduce Pericardin filament width and increase CadN2 expression. Our future work aims to decouple their respective contribution to the protective effects of Loxl2 reduction during aging., Our data suggest that Loxl’s action as a transcriptional regulator may be conserved, which we can now explore in more detail utilizing the advantages of the Drosophila genetic system (McGuire et al. 2004; Allocca et al. 2018; Heigwer et al. 2018). Loxl2’s known interactions indicate that its role in aging could be through EMT which involves a transitional state that may be partially activated during aging (Brabletz et al. 2018) and interestingly EMT is even being pursued in age-related telomere shortening (Imran et al. 2021). Further investigation into the extent Loxl2 regulation in the ECM and EMT pathways in Drosophila plays with age, particularly the molecular partners and signaling of Loxl2 in the ECM and nucleus, can now be genetically explored in Drosophila. It is tempting to speculate that aging clocks and transcriptomic trajectory turning points may be picking up signals of the EMT process at a critical timepoint (20–40 years), the time at which aging phenotypes begin to be seen in humans., The arrhythmia indices in aging Loxl2 RNAi flies without RU revealed roughly 1/3 of flies had increased arrythmia at aged timepoints revealing a biphasic distribution of arrhythmicity in the population. This is consistent with the variation that generally occurs with age, although it is not fully understood what causes this increase in variation between individuals with age (even when the population starts from the same or similar genotypes). It may be that the effects of epigenetic changes during development generate phenotypic and molecular variations that are exaggerated with age (Zhang et al. 2020). The reduction of Loxl2 may help delay certain transcriptional aspects of aging and in turn delay the effects of those variations., Although we cannot totally rule out off target effects of the RNAi, according to the Harvard Transgenic RNAi Project led by Norbert Perrimon group, there were no off targets predicted for the RNAi line used (Perkins et al. 2015). We confirmed Loxl2 knockdown with RT-qPCR (Supplementary Figure S2), and the Drosophila RNAi phenotypes are consistent with the known crosslinking functions and cardiac effects in mouse Loxl2 knockdown models (Yang et al. 2016; Martínez Rodríguez and González 2019). It is also true that some drivers do have an effect on lifespan when combined with RU feeding in mated female flies (Landis et al. 2015), the GAL4 drivers utilized within this manuscript have been previously tested for cardiac arrythmia, lifespan, and stress impacts under RU feeding (Shaposhnikov et al. 2015; Cannon et al. 2017). Several lines of evidence including reduced lifespan or increased arrythmia under RU for several crosses from the aforementioned studies, as well as our male Loxl2 and female CG3529 lifespan data, provide support that these drivers are less likely to be affected by a positive sexually dimorphic effect of RU feeding on lifespan., Because we saw cardiac aging related phenotypes in our Loxl2 data, but no turning point studies have been done on the heart, we wanted to see if Loxl2 had turning points in the human heart. We utilized the GTEx Portal [from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project] to determine if Loxl2 had a transcriptome trajectory turning point in the human atria or ventricles within the timeframe that was seen in the brain or blood transcriptome trajectory turning point studies (Skene et al. 2017; Lehallier et al. 2019). Importantly, Loxl2 changes its average expression trajectory in the heart chambers in the 30–39 age decile consistent with the majority of transcriptome trajectory turning points seen in the blood study (Lehallier et al. 2019). Further turning point studies using human heart data would reveal other molecules important in cardiovascular aging., Fly lines are available upon request.

Our improved AID system should facilitate the construction of conditional loss-of-function mutants in fission yeast., Studies of gene functions, especially the functions of essential genes, are greatly assisted by the conditional inactivation of genes. Diverse strategies have been employed to achieve conditional disruption of gene functions. For model yeast species, these strategies include creating temperature-sensitive mutants (Dohmen et al. 1994; Kanemaki et al. 2003; Ben-Aroya et al. 2008), placing a target gene under the control of a repressible promoter (Mnaimneh et al. 2004), and chemically induced alteration of the localization of the gene product (Haruki et al. 2008). One particularly powerful strategy that has gained wide-spread use in recent years is the auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology, which adopts a protein degradation mechanism in plants for conditional depletion of proteins in nonplant organisms (Nishimura et al. 2009; Kanke et al. 2011; Nishimura and Kanemaki 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Natsume et al. 2016; Natsume and Kanemaki 2017; Texier et al. 2018)., In plants, auxin, a plant hormone, promotes the degradation of auxin/indole-3-acetic acid proteins (Aux/IAAs) by acting as a molecular glue to mediate the interactions between Aux/IAAs and transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling F-box proteins (TIR1/AFBs), which are F-box proteins in SCF (Skp1, Cullin, and F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Tan et al. 2007). Aux/IAAs and TIR1/AFBs only exist in land plants (Mutte et al. 2018), but when an Aux/IAA protein and a TIR1/AFB protein are introduced together into yeast or animal cells, they are sufficient to recapitulate auxin-induced degradation by acting with endogenous SCF components (Nishimura et al. 2009). This is the mechanistic basis of the AID technology., An AID system is composed of three components: a degron fused to the target protein, an F-box protein, and a small molecule inducer. The IAA17 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana has often been used as the degron (Nishimura et al. 2009; Kanke et al. 2011). The most widely used F-box proteins in AID systems are the TIR1 proteins from A. thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), which are referred to as AtTIR1 and OsTIR1, respectively. OsTIR1 works better than AtTIR1 at temperatures higher than 24°C and is a preferred choice for yeasts and mammalian cells, whose optimal growth temperatures are higher than 24°C (Nishimura et al. 2009)., The widely used small molecule inducer in AID systems, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or its synthetic analog naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), is generally assumed to be inert in nonplant species. However, over 50 years ago, physiological effects of IAA and NAA on certain yeast species have been described (Yanagishima and Masuda 1965; Kamisaka et al. 1967). Many fungal species are now known to synthesize auxin and/or exhibit physiological responses to auxin (Fu et al. 2015; Chanclud and Morel 2016). In particular, the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to synthesize and secrete auxin (Rao et al. 2010). Furthermore, in S. cerevisiae, IAA promotes the morphological transition to a filamentous form, retards growth, and inhibits the activity of TORC1 (Prusty et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2016; Snyder et al. 2019; Nicastro et al. 2021), and NAA exhibits a stronger TORC1 inhibition effect than IAA (Prusty et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2016; Snyder et al. 2019; Nicastro et al. 2021). In the other model yeast, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, growth inhibition was observed in the presence of high concentrations of NAA (Kanke et al. 2011). Thus, using IAA or NAA as an inducer in the AID systems, especially at a high concentration, may cause unintended consequences in yeasts., The AID technology was first adopted for use in S. pombe by Kanke et al. (2011). In the AID system of Kanke et al. (named the i-AID system by Kanke et al. and hereafter referred to as the Kanke system), plant F-box proteins were fused to S. pombe Skp1 to increase the efficiency of target protein depletion. However, Skp1-fused AtTIR1 is toxic to S. pombe when expressed from a strong promoter (Kanke et al. 2011). Thus, in the Kanke system, a moderate-strength promoter, Padh15, was used to express the Skp1-fused F-box proteins. The Kanke system was tested on 15 essential genes. Out of these genes, severe growth inhibition was observed for only 3 genes and no effect was detected for 6 genes (Kanke et al. 2011). Combining the Kanke system with a transcription shut-off approach resulted in conditional lethality for all 15 essential genes (Kanke et al. 2011). It is desirable to further improve the efficiency of the AID system for S. pombe so that the AID system alone is sufficient to generate conditional null phenotypes for a high percentage of genes., Here, we report an improved AID system for S. pombe. We show that our system is more efficient than the Kanke system and can generate conditional lethality for all essential genes tested, including ones that are refractory to the Kanke system., Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The C-terminal degron tagging plasmid pDB4581 was constructed by cloning a synthetic DNA fragment into a kanMX-marked pFA6a-derived C-terminal tagging plasmid backbone. The synthetic DNA fragment, which contains the sequence encoding the XTEN16 linker (SGSETPGTSESATPES) and three tandem copies of a 36-amino-acid region of IAA17 (amino acids 71-106 of IAA17, termed sAID for short AID), was synthesized by Wuxi Qinglan Biotech. When designing the DNA sequence, we preferentially chose codons favored by S. pombe. To reduce the chance of recombination between the three copies of sAID-coding sequences, codons were chosen so that between-copy nucleotide identities are lower than 80%.,  The plasmids created and used in this study,  The plasmids created and used in this study, Plasmids for integrating the OsTIR1 expression cassettes are based on the vector plasmid pDB4697. pDB4697 was constructed by cloning a 2567-bp ura4-gene-containing sequence from the S. pombe genome (chromosome III: 114,830–117,653) into the pEASY-blunt vector (TransGen Biotech) and placing it between two NotI sites. This sequence contains the 1.8-kb region deleted in ura4-D18 and sequences flanking the 1.8-kb deleted region (about 400 bp on each side). Padh1-OsTIR1 integrating plasmid pDB5050 was constructed by cloning the S. pombe Padh1 promoter, OsTIR1 coding sequence codon-optimized for S. pombe (synthesized by Wuxi Qinglan Biotech), and the terminator of S. cerevisiae ADH1 gene into an AvrII site about 70 bp downstream of the coding sequence of ura4 in pDB4697. Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A integrating plasmid pDB4695 was constructed by mutating the codon for amino acid 74 of OsTIR1 from TTT (Phe) to GCT (Ala). Primers used for plasmid construction are listed in Supplementary Table S1. pDB4581, pDB4697, pDB5050, and pDB4695 have been deposited at Addgene (Addgene IDs 171124–171127) and the Yeast Genetic Resource Center of Japan (YGRC/NBRP) (https://yeast.nig.ac.jp, last accessed November 19, 2021) (NBRP IDs FYP4960–4963)., Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Strains constructed by Kanke et al. were acquired from the Yeast Genetic Resource Center of Japan (YGRC/NBRP) (https://yeast.nig.ac.jp, last accessed November 19, 2021). The IAA17-tagged alleles and the F-box-protein-expressing cassettes generated by Kanke et al. were combined with AID components created in this study by crossing. To integrate the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette or the Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A cassette into the genome, we transformed a ura4-D18 strain with NotI-digested pDB5050 or pDB4695. Ends-out recombination led to the integration of the cassette and converted the strain to ura4+. Integration at the ura4 locus was verified by PCR. Endogenous C-terminal tagging of target genes with the 3×sAID degron was performed using a PCR-based tagging method. Briefly, in step 1, the degron cassette was amplified from pDB4581 using primers TAG-F and TAG-R and two homology arms were amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pair of orf_F and up_ov_R3 and the primer pair of dn_ov_F3 and dn_R, respectively. In step 2, overlap PCR using the three PCR products from step 1 as templates and orf_F and dn_R as primers generated the final PCR product used for transformation. Transformation mix was spread on YES plates, incubated at 30°C for 2 days, and then replica plated on G418-containing YES plates. Primers used for strain construction are listed in Supplementary Table S1. We have deposited 10 strains, including strains with integrated Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette or Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A cassette at the Yeast Genetic Resource Center of Japan (YGRC/NBRP) (https://yeast.nig.ac.jp, last accessed November 19, 2021) (NBRP IDs FY39919–39928) (Supplementary Table S2)., 5-adamantyl-IAA was synthesized using a protocol modified from two previously reported procedures (Petit et al.2009; Sämann et al. 2014). First, 5-adamantyl-indole was generated through Negishi coupling of 5-iodoindole and an adamantylzinc reagent, which was prepared from the corresponding adamantylmagnesium reagent via transmetallation. 5-adamantyl-IAA was then synthesized from 5-adamantyl-indole via glyoxylation and a selective ketone reduction procedure. Full experimental details were presented in Supplementary Figure S1., We note that 5-adamantyl-IAA has recently become available from several commercial vendors including Tokyo Chemical Industry (product number A3390)., The compositions of media used in this study were as described (Forsburg and Rhind 2006). Unless otherwise specified, cells were cultured at 30°C in pombe minimal medium with glutamate (PMG) containing necessary supplements. For preparing NAA-containing media, we added into the medium 0.5 M NAA stock solution (dissolved in 1 M NaOH and stored at −20°C) and, if necessary, adjusted the pH of the medium to 6.0 using 1 M HCl. For preparing 5-adamantyl-IAA-containing media, we added into the medium 1 mM 5-adamantyl-IAA stock suspension (dissolved in 1 M NaOH and stored at −20°C; residual undissolved particles did not affect aliquoting if mixed thoroughly) and, if necessary, adjusted the pH of the medium to 6.0 using 1 M HCl. If dilution was needed before adding to the medium, the stock solution/suspension was diluted in water. The pH of the medium was not obviously affected by NaOH in the stock solution/suspension and no adjustment of pH was needed if the final dilution ratio was 1000-folds or higher, i.e., if the final concentration of NAA ≤ 0.5 mM and if the final concentration of 5-adamantyl-IAA ≤ 1 μM. NAA was from Sigma (catalog number N0640)., For the spot assay, cultures were grown to log phase in a liquid medium and serial fivefold dilutions of cells were spotted on plates and incubated at 30°C. After colony formation, the plates were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 photo scanner., Cell lysates were prepared using a trichloroacetic acid extraction method (Ulrich and Davies 2009). Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-mini-AID antibody (MBL, Code No. M214-3) and an HRP AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody (EarthOx, E030110-01)., A log-phase culture of strain DY38751 grown in PMG liquid medium was diluted to OD600 = 0.2 and split into six equal aliquots. Into two aliquots, we added 2 mM NAA (250-fold dilution from 0.5 M NAA stock dissolved in 1 M NaOH). Into another two aliquots, we added 4 µM 5-adamantyl-IAA (250-fold dilution of 1 mM 5-adamantyl-IAA stock dissolved in 1 M NaOH). The remaining two aliquots were added with equivalent amounts of 1 M NaOH and served as controls. 1 M HCl was added to the six aliquots to adjust the pH to 6.0. These six cultures were incubated at 30°C for 6 h. Cells were then collected and RNA was isolated using the hot phenol method (Lyne et al. 2003). RNA-seq library preparation and Illumina sequencing were performed by Annoroad Gene Technology (Beijing, China)., Strains and plasmids are available upon request. Supplementary files available at Figshare include five supplementary figures (Supplementary Figures S1–S5) and three supplementary tables (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Primers and strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Results of the RNA-seq analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S3., It is known that in AID systems, high expression levels of the plant F-box proteins are crucial for efficient protein depletion (Nishimura et al. 2009; Kanke et al. 2011; Nishimura and Kanemaki 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Natsume et al. 2016; Natsume and Kanemaki 2017; Texier et al. 2018). In the Kanke system, the F-box protein AtTIR1 is fused with S. pombe Skp1 and two copies of SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) and is expressed from the moderate-strength Padh15 promoter (Kanke et al. 2011). Because in many other species, plant F-box proteins have been successfully used without fusing to endogenous Skp1 (Nishimura et al. 2009; Kanke et al. 2011; Nishimura and Kanemaki 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Natsume et al. 2016; Natsume and Kanemaki 2017; Texier et al. 2018), we envisioned that Skp1 fusion may not be necessary for S. pombe. Expressing the F-box proteins without Skp1 fusion may avoid toxicity and allow the F-box proteins to be expressed from a strong promoter. Thus, we decided to not fuse the F-box protein with Skp1 in our system., The choice of fusing AtTIR1 with two copies of NLS in the Kanke system stemmed from the intention of only applying the system to degrade nuclear proteins. When AtTIR1 is concentrated inside the nucleus by the NLSs, it may no longer be effective at degrading cytoplasmic proteins. We aimed to develop a system that can be used for degrading both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Because F-box proteins are relatively small (<70 kDa), they do not need an NLS to enter the nucleus and in the absence of NLS-dependent active transport into the nucleus, they can still passively diffuse through nuclear pores on the timescale of minutes (Timney et al. 2016). Therefore, we chose to not add an NLS to the F-box protein in our system., An OsTIR1 coding sequence codon-optimized for S. pombe was obtained by gene synthesis and placed under the control of the strong Padh1 promoter (Figure 1A). The OsTIR1-expressing cassette (hereafter referred to as Padh1-OsTIR1) was integrated at the ura4 locus by ends-out recombination using the plasmid pDB5050 (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S2A). Codon-optimized OsTIR1 expressed from the strong Padh1 promoter showed no obvious toxicity in the absence of auxin and the AID degron (Supplementary Figure S2B)., Padh1 promoter-expressed OsTIR1 is more effective than F-box proteins used in the Kanke system. (A) Schematic of the genome-integrated cassettes expressing F-box proteins (not drawn to scale). The Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette expressing codon-optimized OsTIR1 from the strong Padh1 promoter was designed and constructed in this study. The Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS cassette and the Padh15-double-skp1-TIR1 cassette were developed by Kanke et al. (2011). (B) Spot assay showed that growth inhibition occurred at a lower concentration of NAA when the mcm4-IAA17 allele was combined with the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette than when combined with the Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS cassette or the Padh15-double-skp1-TIR1 cassette., Padh1 promoter-expressed OsTIR1 is more effective than F-box proteins used in the Kanke system. (A) Schematic of the genome-integrated cassettes expressing F-box proteins (not drawn to scale). The Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette expressing codon-optimized OsTIR1 from the strong Padh1 promoter was designed and constructed in this study. The Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS cassette and the Padh15-double-skp1-TIR1 cassette were developed by Kanke et al. (2011). (B) Spot assay showed that growth inhibition occurred at a lower concentration of NAA when the mcm4-IAA17 allele was combined with the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette than when combined with the Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS cassette or the Padh15-double-skp1-TIR1 cassette., To test the effectiveness of the Padh1 promoter-expressed OsTIR1 in an AID system, we targeted the essential gene mcm4, which encodes a nuclear protein required for DNA replication. For essential genes, effective disruption of gene function manifests as growth retardation. We used the degron-tagged mcm4 allele generated by Kanke et al., mcm4-IAA17, in which the full-length IAA17 was used as the degron. Kanke et al. previously developed two versions of integrated F-box-protein-expressing cassettes, Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS and Padh15-double-skp1-TIR1 (Figure 1A). Both versions, when combined with the mcm4-IAA17 allele, resulted in obvious but incomplete growth inhibition at 30°C when the inducer NAA was added at the concentration of 500 µM, which is the concentration previously used by Kanke et al. (Figure 1B). In contrast, when our Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette was combined with the mcm4-IAA17 allele, complete growth inhibition was observed at 125 µM of NAA (Figure 1B). Because Padh1-OsTIR1 resulted in a stronger growth inhibition at a fourfold lower concentration of inducer, we concluded that Padh1-OsTIR1 is more effective than the F-box-protein-expressing cassettes of the Kanke system for disrupting the function of mcm4., To determine whether the higher effectiveness of the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette holds true in general, we targeted two other essential genes cdc45 and orc2, both of which encode nuclear proteins. Using the cdc45-IAA17 and orc2-IAA17 alleles generated by Kanke et al., we found that for both genes, Padh1-OsTIR1 was more potent than the F-box-protein-expressing cassettes developed by Kanke et al. (Supplementary Figure S3). Together, these results indicate that Padh1-OsTIR1 is an improvement of the AID system for S. pombe., In the Kanke system, the full-length IAA17 is used as the degron (Kanke et al. 2011). To reduce the size of the degron and thereby minimize the possibility of the fused degron interfering with the function of the target protein, we selected a 36-amino-acid sequence from the IAA17 protein (amino acids 71–106 of IAA17, hereafter referred to as sAID, for short AID) based on sequence conservation and known structure-function relationship of Aux/IAA proteins (Figure 2A). sAID is shorter than previously reported small-size AID degrons derived from IAA17, including AID*, AID47, and mini-AID (Kubota et al. 2013; Morawska and Ulrich 2013; Brosh et al. 2016; Natsume et al. 2016; Yesbolatova et al. 2019) (Supplementary Figure S4A). Based on a previous report showing that three copies of mini-AID worked better than a single copy of mini-AID (Kubota et al. 2013), we used three tandem copies of the sAID sequence as the degron (hereafter referred to as 3×sAID) (Figure 2A). To avoid recombination between the three copies, we introduced synonymous variations in the three copies, so that between-copy nucleotide identities are lower than 80% (Supplementary Figure S4B)., 3×sAID is a more effective degron than the full-length IAA17.

ADH1ter and kanMX are the terminator of S. cerevisiae ADH1 gene and the G418-resistance selection marker, respectively. (C) Spot assay showed that growth inhibition occurred at a lower concentration of NAA when the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette was combined with mcm4-3×sAID than when combined with mcm4-IAA17., 3×sAID is a more effective degron than the full-length IAA17.

(C) Spot assay showed that growth inhibition occurred at a lower concentration of NAA when the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette was combined with mcm4-3×sAID than when combined with mcm4-IAA17., We constructed a C-terminal 3×sAID tagging plasmid (pDB4581) (Table 1 and Figure 2B), which is based on the pFA6a-derived tagging plasmid series (Bahler et al. 1998; Longtine et al. 1998). In this plasmid, upstream of the 3×sAID degron, we added a 16-amino-acid XTEN16 linker (SGSETPGTSESATPES), which was initially developed by David Liu’s lab for linking Cas9 and FokI and has been adopted by Jonathan Weissman’s lab as a linker between an AID tag and the target protein (Guilinger et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2018). Like other pFA6a-derived C-terminal tagging plasmids, when using pDB4581 as a template for PCR-based C-terminal tagging, a 7-amino-acid linker (RIPGLIN) is present immediately downstream of the target protein. The total length of the amino acid sequence added to the target protein, including the 3×sAID degron and the linkers, is only 131 amino acids, substantially shorter than the length of full-length IAA17 (229 amino acids)., To test whether the 3×sAID degron is more effective than the full-length IAA17 used in the Kanke system, we endogenously tagged Mcm4 with the 3×sAID degron. When mcm4-3×sAID was combined with Padh1-OsTIR1, nearly complete growth inhibition was observed at 7.81 µM of NAA (Figure 2C). Because mcm4-IAA17 in combination with Padh1-OsTIR1 did not show as severe a growth phenotype at a fourfold higher concentration of NAA (31.25 µM) (Figure 2C), we concluded that 3×sAID is a more effective degron than the full-length IAA17 for targeting mcm4., We tested the new degron on two additional essential genes pol1 and cdc20. In combination with Padh1-OsTIR1, pol1-IAA17 allele previously constructed by Kanke et al. exhibited a moderate growth inhibition at 500 µM of NAA, whereas pol1-3×sAID allele exhibited a nearly complete growth inhibition at 31.25 µM of NAA (Supplementary Figure S5A). For cdc20, in combination with Padh1-OsTIR1, the cdc20-IAA17 allele previously constructed by Kanke et al. showed no obvious growth phenotype at 500 µM of NAA, whereas the same concentration of NAA completely inhibited the growth of cdc20-3×sAID strain (Supplementary Figure S5B). Together, these results indicate that 3×sAID is superior to the full-length IAA as a degron in AID systems., Because auxins including IAA and NAA are known to have physiological effects on yeasts, such as growth impediment and perturbation of TORC1, we decided to adopt a synthetic auxin analog, 5-adamantyl-IAA, as the inducer for the AID system. Compared to IAA, 5-adamantyl-IAA bears an extra bulky adamantane group (Figure 3A), and thus is unlikely to cause the same physiological effects as auxins cause. Furthermore, 5-adamantyl-IAA can induce an interaction between the F79A mutant form of AtTIR1, which has an enlarged auxin-binding pocket, and Aux/IAA proteins at an extremely low concentration of 10 pM (Torii et al. 2018; Uchida et al. 2018; Yamada et al. 2018), suggesting the possibility of using 5-adamantyl-IAA as an AID inducer at much lower concentrations than auxins. In OsTIR1, the F74A mutation is equivalent to the F79A mutation in AtTIR1. We introduced the F74A mutation into codon-optimized OsTIR1 of the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette and generated a plasmid for integrating the Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A cassette at the ura4 locus through ends-out recombination (pDB4695) (Figure 3B and Table 1). Like OsTIR1 expressed from the Padh1 promoter, OsTIR1-F74A expressed from the Padh1 promoter did not cause obvious growth inhibition in the absence of auxin and the AID degron (Supplementary Figure S2B)., 5-adamantyl-IAA is a highly effective inducer when paired with OsTIR1-F74A. (A) The structures of IAA, NAA, and 5-adamantyl-IAA. (B) Schematic showing that NAA preferentially binds OsTIR1, whereas 5-adamantyl-IAA preferentially binds OsTIR1-F74A. (C) Spot assay showed that Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A was less effective than Padh1-OsTIR1 when using NAA as the inducer. (D) Spot assay showed that Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A but not Padh1-OsTIR1 was effective when using 5-adamantyl-IAA as the inducer. Spot assay was performed using PMG plates incubated at 30°C., 5-adamantyl-IAA is a highly effective inducer when paired with OsTIR1-F74A. (A) The structures of IAA, NAA, and 5-adamantyl-IAA.

(D) Spot assay showed that Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A but not Padh1-OsTIR1 was effective when using 5-adamantyl-IAA as the inducer. Spot assay was performed using PMG plates incubated at 30°C., We compared the abilities of Padh1-OsTIR1 and Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A to generate growth inhibitory effects on cells harboring the mcm4-3×sAID allele in response to the two different inducers NAA and 5-adamantyl-IAA (Figure 3, C and D). As expected, Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A was less effective than Padh1-OsTIR1 when using NAA as the inducer (Figure 3C), presumably because the F74A mutation makes NAA not fit well in the auxin-binding pocket. When using 5-adamantyl-IAA as the inducer, we found that, remarkably, 1 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA was enough to completely inhibit the growth of cells containing the Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A cassette (Figure 3D). In contrast, hardly any growth inhibitory effect was observed at 100 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA for cells containing the Padh1-OsTIR1 cassette, consistent with the expectation that the bulky adamantane group of 5-adamantyl-IAA makes it unable to fit into the auxin-binding pocket of wild-type OsTIR1 (Figure 3D). The fact that 1 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA in combination with Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A generated a stronger growth inhibition than 7.81 µM of NAA in combination with Padh1-OsTIR1 (comparing the second row in Figure 3C and the third row in Figure 3D) suggests that 5-adamantyl-IAA is a highly effective inducer when paired with OsTIR1-F74A and can be used at concentrations thousands of times lower than NAA used in combination with wild-type OsTIR1. We concluded that the combination of the 3×sAID degron, the Padh1-OsTIR1-F74A cassette, and 5-adamantyl-IAA as the inducer constitute an improved AID system for S. pombe (Figure 4)., The improved AID system for S. pombe. Schematic of the improved AID system. OsTIR1-F74A can form a functional E3 ligase complex with endogenous SCF components. 5-adamantyl-IAA acts as a molecular glue to promote the interaction between OsTIR1-F74A and 3×sAID, resulting in the degradation of the 3×sAID fused target protein, likely in a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent manner., The improved AID system for S. pombe. Schematic of the improved AID system. OsTIR1-F74A can form a functional E3 ligase complex with endogenous SCF components. 5-adamantyl-IAA acts as a molecular glue to promote the interaction between OsTIR1-F74A and 3×sAID, resulting in the degradation of the 3×sAID fused target protein, likely in a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent manner., Kanke et al. (2011) has tested their AID system on 15 essential genes, all of which encode nuclear proteins, and found that for only three of these 15 genes, severe growth phenotype can be obtained. We applied our improved AID system on eight genes previously tested by Kanke et al. (Table 2), including two genes (mcm4 and orc2) that exhibited severe growth defect using the Kanke system, two genes (cdc45 and orc6) that exhibited moderate growth defect using the Kanke system, and four genes (pol1, cdc20, mcm10, and ssl3) that exhibited no growth phenotype using the Kanke system. The improved AID system was able to generate induced lethality (complete growth inhibition on a medium containing 5-adamantyl-IAA) for all eight genes encoding nuclear proteins. Consistent with the results of Kanke et al. higher concentrations of 5-adamantyl-IAA were required to generate induced lethality for the genes that exhibited weaker phenotype in the Kanke system (Table 2). cdc20, mcm10, and ssl3 required the highest concentration of 5-adamantyl-IAA (100 nM) for complete growth inhibition. We concluded that our improved AID system permits inactivation of genes refractory to the Kanke system and 100 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA should be sufficient for generating a strong inactivating effect for most target genes.,  Our improved AID system is effective on genes that are refractory to the Kanke system, Growth phenotype was examined by spot assays using PMG plates containing 4 different concentrations of 5-adamantyl-IAA (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nM) at 30°C.,  Our improved AID system is effective on genes that are refractory to the Kanke system, Growth phenotype was examined by spot assays using PMG plates containing 4 different concentrations of 5-adamantyl-IAA (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nM) at 30°C., Kanke et al. (2011) has only tested their system on genes encoding nuclear proteins. In our system, we intentionally opted to not add an NLS to the F-box protein OsTIR1 so that it can target both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. To test whether the improved AID system is effective in disrupting the functions of genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins, we endogenously tagged two cytoplasmic proteins, Sec8 and Sec16, with 3×sAID at their C-termini. Both Sec8 and Sec16 are essential for growth. Complete growth inhibition was observed with 100 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA for both sec8-3×sAID and sec16-3×sAID in PMG, EMM, and YES media (Figure 5). These results suggest that our improved AID system can efficiently disrupt the functions of cytoplasmic proteins in S. pombe, and the type of medium does not strongly affect the efficiency of the system., The improved AID system is effective on cytoplasmic proteins. Spot assay showed that complete growth inhibition was achieved when using the improved AID system to disrupt the functions of two essential genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins. Spot assays were performed on PMG, EMM, YES plates as indicated., The improved AID system is effective on cytoplasmic proteins. Spot assay showed that complete growth inhibition was achieved when using the improved AID system to disrupt the functions of two essential genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins. Spot assays were performed on PMG, EMM, YES plates as indicated., To directly assess the extent of protein depletion driven by our improved AID system, we performed immunoblotting analysis (Figure 6). Mcm4-3×sAID was depleted to below-detection level after treating the cells with 5-adamantyl-IAA for 15 min (Figure 6A). Sec8-3×sAID was depleted substantially after 15 min treatment and was depleted to below-detection level after 8 h treatment (Figure 6B). These data indicate that complete or near-complete protein depletion can be achieved using the improved AID system., Complete or near-complete protein depletion can be achieved using the improved AID system.

After incubation for the indicated times, cells were collected and lysed. Proteins in whole-cell extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-mini-AID monoclonal antibody (MBL M214-3). Coomassie brilliant blue staining of PVDF membrane was used as loading control., Complete or near-complete protein depletion can be achieved using the improved AID system.

Coomassie brilliant blue staining of PVDF membrane was used as loading control., To experimentally assess whether NAA and 5-adamantyl-IAA may cause undesirable side effects in S. pombe, we performed RNA-seq analysis on S. pombe cells containing neither an AID degron nor a TIR1 protein. We treated cells with either 2 mM of NAA or 4 μM of 5-adamantyl-IAA for 6 h. Two millimolar of NAA is four times the concentration recommended by Kanke et al. (2011) for the Kanke system; 4 μM of 5-adamantyl-IAA is 40 times the maximal concentration we used with our improved AID system. In our hands, neither 2 mM of NAA nor 4 μM of 5-adamantyl-IAA caused an obvious growth phenotype (our unpublished observations). Using fold changes > 2 and adjusted P-values < 0.05 as cutoffs for differentially expressed genes, we found that 18 genes were up-regulated and 10 genes were down-regulated upon NAA treatment (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, using the same cutoffs, no differentially expressed genes were found in cells treated with 5-adamantyl-IAA (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table S3). These results indicate that a high concentration of NAA can alter the transcriptome of S. pombe, whereas 5-adamantyl-IAA at a concentration far higher than those used in our improved AID system had no obvious effect on the transcriptome., Two millimolar of NAA but not 4 μM of 5-adamantyl-IAA perturbed the transcriptome. Changes in the transcriptome are visualized using volcano plots. Left, NAA-treated samples are compared with control samples; right, 5-adamantyl-IAA-treated samples are compared with control samples. The x-axis shows the Log2 (fold change) in transcript levels between treated and control samples. The two vertical dashed lines denote Log2 (fold change)  = −1 and 1, respectively.

The smallest adjusted P-value for NAA treatment, that of the gene SPCC569.05c, is 5.5654E-197. For better visualization, we arbitrarily set the adjusted P-value of SPCC569.05c to 1E-130. For genes that were given NA values for adjusted P-values by DESeq2, we set their adjusted P-values to 1., Two millimolar of NAA but not 4 μM of 5-adamantyl-IAA perturbed the transcriptome.

For genes that were given NA values for adjusted P-values by DESeq2, we set their adjusted P-values to 1., Here, we report an improved AID system that permits efficient disruption of gene function in fission yeast. In this system, we combine an improved degron composed of three tandem copies of a 36-amino-acid sequence from IAA17, codon-optimized OsTIR1-F74A expressed from a strong promoter, and 5-adamantyl-IAA as an inducer to minimize side effects. This system is effective in disrupting the functions of 10 essential genes, including genes that are refractory to a previously reported system., During the preparation of our manuscript, another study on improving the AID system for S. pombe was published (Watson et al. 2021). Similar to our findings, Watson et al. also showed that OsTIR1 not fused with Skp1 can be expressed from a strong promoter without causing toxicity and is more effective in inactivating mcm4 than the Padh15-skp1-AtTIR1-NLS cassette of the Kanke system. Like the Kanke system, Watson et al. aimed to use their system for depleting nuclear proteins and therefore added an NLS to OsTIR1. They showed that two nuclear proteins, Mcm4 and Rad52, were effectively depleted. It is likely that using an NLS to target OsTIR1 to the nucleus can lower the efficiency of depleting cytoplasmic proteins. In our system, we intentionally chose to not add an NLS to OsTIR1 to allow broad applicability. Indeed, genes encoding both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins can be effectively inactivated using our improved system., We showed in this study that, when paired with OsTIR1-F74A, 5-adamantyl-IAA is a highly effective inducer for the AID system and can minimize side effects on the transcriptome. Several recently published studies have also demonstrated that a bulky auxin analog, when paired with a mutant form of OsTIR1 with an enlarged auxin-binding pocket, acts as an effective AID inducer at much lower concentrations than auxin (Nishimura et al. 2020; Yesbolatova et al. 2020; Watson et al. 2021). When we initiated this study in 2018, 5-adamantyl-IAA was not commercially available and therefore we obtained it by chemical synthesis. Recently, it has become available from several commercial vendors. Because 5-adamantyl-IAA can be used at very low concentrations, it is a highly cost-effective inducer. For example, the amount of 5-adamantyl-IAA needed to prepare 1 l of medium containing 100 nM of 5-adamantyl-IAA costs less than half a US dollar., In mammalian cell lines, OsTIR1-based AID systems have been reported to cause the degradation of degron-fused target proteins and generate loss-of-function phenotypes in the absence of the auxin inducer (Natsume et al. 2016; Li et al. 2019; Sathyan et al. 2019; Yesbolatova et al. 2019). In budding yeast, auxin-independent depletion of AID-tagged proteins was also observed when OsTIR1 was expressed to a high level (Mendoza-Ochoa et al. 2019). This undesirable phenomenon, called “basal degradation” or “leaky degradation,” has been tackled by a number of approaches, including placing OsTIR1 under the control of a repressible promoter (Natsume et al. 2016; Mendoza-Ochoa et al. 2019), adding a small molecule antagonist of OsTIR1 (Yesbolatova et al. 2019), switching to a different F-box protein (Li et al. 2019), expressing another plant auxin signaling protein ARF (Sathyan et al. 2019), and using the OsTIR1-F74G mutant (Yesbolatova et al. 2020). It was reported that in budding yeast, OsTIR1-F74A, when expressed from the GAL1-10 promoter, can cause inducer-independent loss-of-function phenotypes (Yesbolatova et al. 2020). In fission yeast, we have not noticed any obvious inducer-independent phenotypes using either wild-type OsTIR1 or OsTIR1-F74A expressed from the strong Padh1 promoter (spot assay data shown in this study). Furthermore, our immunoblotting analysis showed that, in the absence of inducer, OsTIR1-F74A expressed from the strong Padh1 promoter did not obviously alter the protein levels of Mcm4-3×sAID and Sec8-3×sAID (Figure 6). Thus, under the experimental conditions we have used, basal degradation is not an apparent problem with our improved AID system for fission yeast. If this problem arises under other experimental conditions, the myriad of solutions mentioned above can be applied to address it., The strengths and advantages of S. pombe as an experimental model organism rely on the continuing development of technologies empowering its use in biological research. Understanding gene functions is a core pursuit of biological research. Our improved AID system is a new addition to a long list of tools and methods for creating conditional loss-of-function mutants in S. pombe (Basi et al. 1993; Rajagopalan et al. 2004; Boe et al. 2008; Kearsey and Gregan 2009; Kanke et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2011; Pai et al. 2012; Watson et al. 2013; Ding et al. 2014; Watson et al. 2021). This system will facilitate the analysis of gene functions in S. pombe, especially the functions of essential genes., The RNA-seq sequencing reads were aligned to the S. pombe reference genome sequence using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 with the options “–min-intronlen 28 –max-intronlen 820” (Kim et al. 2019). The CDS coordinates of protein-coding genes were from the annotation file Schizosaccharomyces_pombe.ASM294v2.44.gtf (ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/fungi/release-44/gtf/schizosaccharomyces_pombe/, last accessed November 19, 2021). Reads mapped to each CDS were counted by featureCounts version 2.0.1 with the options “-p -s 0 -F SAF” (Liao et al. 2014). Differential expression analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 version 1.28.1 (Love et al. 2014). Volcano plots were generated using the R package EnhancedVolcano version 1.6.0 (https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano, last accessed November 19, 2021).

We hope this study can be incorporated into existing knowledge surrounding the genetics of uterine cancer and soon become clinical biomarkers as a tool for better prognosis and treatment., Uterine cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and the fourth most common cancer overall among women (Henley et al. 2018; Ward et al. 2019). The incidence of uterine cancer is increasing each year with an estimated 66,000 new cases projected for 2021 in the United States (Henley et al. 2018; Siegel et al. 2021). The 5-year survival rate for all uterine cancers is roughly 81%, but differs significantly based on cancer subtype and stage (Cantrell et al. 2015; Siegel et al. 2021)., Uterine cancer can arise in the endometrium, the lining of the uterus, or in the myometrium, the middle uterine layer composed of muscle. Endometrial cancer is more common than uterine sarcoma (cancer of the myometrium), making up roughly 85% of all uterine cancer cases (Bokhman 1983). Endometrial cancer is an overarching category of cancers, here known as UCEC. Specific subtypes include, but are not limited to, endometrioid cancer, serous adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS). Endometrioid cancer is the most common of the endometrial cancers, making up about 68% of all uterine cancer cases (Henley 2018). However, endometrioid cancer also has the best prognosis as a type 1 estrogen-dependent uterine cancer (Setiawan et al. 2013). In those cases the unopposed estrogen could stem from estrogen-only forms of birth control, the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, or obesity, among other causes (Sakamoto et al. 2002; Setiawan et al. 2013; Lortet-Tieulent et al. 2018). Serous adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and UCS are rarer, each accounting for 3–10% of endometrial cancer cases (Cantrell et al. 2015; Henley et al. 2018). Serous adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma usually arise from atrophied endometrium (Geels et al. 2015). These are considered estrogen-independent (type 2) and are more aggressive than type 1 uterine cancer (Setiawan et al. 2013). They are usually diagnosed after the cancer has spread beyond the uterus, therefore leading to a poorer prognosis (Geels et al. 2015). UCS is a more distinct subtype as it seems to be a cancer of both the endometrium and the myometrium (Cantrell et al. 2015). Based on recent research of the cellular morphology, it is more likely that the initial mutation begins in the endometrium and spreads to the myometrium (Levine 2013; Cantrell et al. 2015). Because of this, UCS is considered a subtype of endometrial cancer. Similar to serous adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma, UCS has a poor prognosis (∼35% survival rate after 5 years) and accounts for 15% of deaths associated with uterine cancer (Vaidya et al. 2006; Cantrell et al. 2015)., To better diagnose, prognose, and treat uterine cancer, biomarkers can be used. A biomarker is a characteristic that indicates a normal or pathogenic process (FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group 2016). Biomarkers can come in many forms, such as oxidative damage in an individual’s plasma to measure the progression of Parkinson’s disease, inflammation markers in blood to predict someone’s risk for cardiovascular disease, and characteristics of EEGs to diagnose major depressive disorder (Pearson et al. 2003; Bogdanov et al. 2008; Pillai et al. 2011). Many cancer-specific genetic biomarkers have also been identified. Some examples include mutations in EGFR and BRAF for nonsmall cell lung cancer, DNA methylation patterns to determine stomach cancer metastasis, and RNA expression of SChLAP1 to predict metastasis of prostate cancer (Prensner et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2017; Pennell et al. 2019). For endometrial cancer, these mutations tend to arise in genes PTEN, TP53, and CTNNB1 (Okuda et al. 2010). Many other genetic mutations have been identified as biomarkers of uterine cancer, some of which we rediscover here through, further ensuring the robustness of method., The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) among other projects have investigated both UCS and UCEC cancers. They have identified many singular genes that tend to be mutated across both cancer types, such as TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, and PPP2R1A (Okuda et al. 2010; Levine 2013; Cherniack et al. 2017). While some are specific to solely UCEC (FGFR2, CTNNB1, and POLE), others have only been associated with UCS (RB1, ZBTB7B, and U2AF1) (Levine 2013; Cherniack et al. 2017). There have also been associations with more general characteristics. Translocations have been found with genes involved in the WNT and PI(3)K pathways, among others. Microsatellite instability is more common in endometrioid cancer compared with serous adenocarcinoma and UCS (Levine 2013). UCS and type 2 UCEC cases tend to have more CNV events compared with UCEC type I cases (Levine 2013; Zhao et al. 2013). Endometrial cancer can also appear in conjunction with Lynch syndrome, which is usually due to mutations in genes involved with DNA mismatch repair (Gayther and Pharoah 2010). These genes include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, with mutations in MSH6 carrying the most risk for developing endometrial cancer (Baglietto et al. 2010; Gayther and Pharoah 2010)., In this study, we assembled groups of related biomarkers, known as a biomarker system or biosignature, that are specific to normal uterine tissue and cancerous uterine tissue. We were interested in two types of biomarker systems: gene coexpression networks (GCNs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Coexpressed genes were discovered by analyzing gene expression data and finding gene pairs that have correlated expression patterns. These coexpressed gene pairs were then assembled to form a GCN. A GCN–GRN was constructed by merging the GCN with directed tissue-specific regulatory edges [transcription factor (TF) to target gene (TR)]. These networks have been used to identify biomarkers for many complex diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and kidney cancer (Chekouo et al. 2015; Hsu et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; Soleimani Zakeri et al. 2020). Networks like these, or even subnetworks, are reproducibly better at classifying disease compared with singular genes (Chuang et al. 2007; Jin et al. 2008). Especially in complex disease, such as cancer, there are multigene pathways responsible for the diagnosis, rather than a small group of genes of interest (Zeng et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014). The associations of those molecular interactions within each condition-specific network allows for a more comprehensive view of the cellular environment compared with singular gene associations., Several other studies have built GCNs specific to endometrial cancer to find genes of interest. One identified several hub genes related to stage, grade, and type of endometrial cancer (Chou et al. 2014). Another study was interested specifically in the coexpression patterns of gene AKT. They were able to identify six coexpressed genes (PBK, BIRC5, AURKA, GTSE1, KNSTRN, and PSMB10), some of which were also able to predict prognosis (Huo et al. 2019). Other studies have discovered additional hub genes with prognostic power, TICRR, PPIF, and ANO1 (Wang et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2021). These previous endometrial cancer studies have all used weighted GCN analysis (WGCNA) to build the GCNs, while we have taken a different approach using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) prior to pairwise gene correlation tests. Our approach allows for analysis of genes that are involved in more than one biological process, and therefore have multiple expression patterns (Ficklin et al. 2017). In this analysis, the GMMs can differentiate between the two expression levels and test each for coexpression edges, whereas WGCNA cannot., Uterine cancer is one of the most common cancers among women, and the incidence is increasing each year. In this study, we aimed to explore the genetic differences between normal and cancerous uterine tissue. By building uterine condition-specific biomarker systems through the use of GMMs, we can contribute to the growing literature of biological associations and changes in genetic relationships to better understand, and potentially better diagnose and treat, uterine cancer., To construct the GEM the FPKM files for all uterine samples (TCGA-Normal, TCGA-UCEC, TCGA-UCS, and GTEx-Normal) and their corresponding sample annotation matrices were downloaded and processed (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5330593, last accessed November 16, 2021) (Wang et al. 2018). The final GEM includes gene expression information across 19,304 genes in 82 GTEx Normal samples, 23 TCGA Normal samples, 141 TCGA UCEC samples, and 47 TCGA UCS samples (Figure 1). Condition-specific GCNs were then constructed using GMMs via Knowledge Independent Network Construction (KINC) software (https://github.com/SystemsGenetics/KINC, last accessed November 16, 2021). We restricted network edges to those with a P-value of <0.001 and consequently created condition-specific subnetworks. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between GEMs of the normal uterine tissue of GTEx (v.6) and TCGA-UCEC, as well as GTEx-Normal and TCGA-UCS. It was completed by DESeq2_1.30.1 in R 4.0 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html, last accessed November 16, 2021).

All GCN nodes, edges and their corresponding DEG status can be found in Supplementary Table S1. The results for the UCEC and UCS DESeq analyses can be found in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The condition-specific GCNs were then overlapped with the results from the differential expression analysis. The global attributes of each GCN network can be found in Table 1. Cytoscape was used to visualize the UCEC, UCS, and GTEx GCN networks, which can be found in Figures 2 and 3, and Supplementary Figure S1, respectively., t-SNE plot of uterus GEM.

From this list of regulatory edges, those enriched in uterus were extracted (N = 60,915). The published uterine regulatory edges were merged with each csGCN to create respective csGRNs, containing both gene coexpression edges and regulatory edges. GRN edges for the cancer networks can be found in Supplementary Table S4 and those for the GTEx GRN can be found in Supplementary Table S5. A summary of which can be found in Table 2. We were also interested in investigating possible coregulation. To do this, “triangle” relationships were extracted from the UCEC GRN. We define a triangle relationship as one in which one TF regulates two genes connected by an edge. To further investigate the regulatory edges and their differences between cancer and normal tissue, we performed a t-test on the FPKM ratio for the regulatory edges. For each regulatory edge the FPKM values for the TF and TR were collected for the corresponding cancer samples and GTEx-Normal samples and underwent a t-test as ratios (TF/TR) to see if they were significantly different (P-value < 1E−5) between the cancerous and normal tissues. Like the GCN analysis, the nodes of each regulatory edge were subject to a differential expression analysis, performed like above. Functional enrichment was performed on the DEGs for each csGCN (UCEC, UCS, UCEC triangle, and GTEx) using ToppFun (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/, last accessed November 16, 2021) (Supplementary Table S6). Further details on these methods can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.by85pzy6 (last accessed November 16, 2021).,  Uterus condition-specific gene coexpression network-gene regulatory network global attributes,  Uterus condition-specific gene coexpression network-gene regulatory network global attributes, A uterine gene expression matrix (GEM) was constructed from normalized and batch-effect-corrected FPKM files for TCGA and GTEx uterine samples, published by Wang et al. (2018) (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5330593, last accessed November 16, 2021). The GEM includes gene expression information for 19,304 genes across 82 GTEx Normal samples, 23 TCGA Normal samples, 141 TCGA-UCEC samples, and 47 TCGA-UCS samples. To visualize the GEM, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in a 2D scatterplot (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008). The t-SNE visualization of the GEM can be found in Figure 1, which shows the spatial representation of the 293 samples, based on their gene expression profiles. The cancer samples, TCGA-UCEC and TCGA-UCS (represented by green and pink dots, respectively), can be seen segregating separate from the normal samples, GTEx-Normal and TCGA-Normal (red and blue, respectively). One TCGA-UCEC outlier was boxed and brought in closer to allow for better visibility of the two main clusters., To construct condition-specific GCNs (csGCNs) from the uterine GEM, we first used Knowledge Independent Network Construction (KINC) (https://github.com/SystemsGenetics/KINC, last accessed November 16, 2021). KINC identifies gene coexpression edges that are condition-specific. The conditions of interest for this study are normal uterine tissue (GTEx-Normal), and two types of cancer (TCGA-UCEC and TCGA-UCS). KINC uses GMMs to cluster samples, then performs a pairwise gene correlation analysis on each cluster. Only clusters with greater than 25 samples were considered, so the TCGA-Normal samples were not used for any further analyses. Condition-specific gene pairs with a Spearman correlation <−0.5 or >0.5 were considered for further testing. Low-powered edges within each cluster were removed, and a hypergeometric test was used to assign P-values to those remaining. Condition-specific networks were created and edges within each network with a P-value >0.001 were removed. Biased edges were also removed, and remaining edges were ranked based on their P-values and similarity scores. Through this process, KINC built three csGCNs: GTEx-Normal (14,044 edges and 4,372 genes), TCGA-UCEC (2,861 edges and 1,496 genes), and TCGA-UCS (24 edges and 39 genes) (Table 1). To get a better idea of network connectivity, we multiplied the number of edges by two and divided that number by the number of nodes to find k. The GTEx-Normal had the highest average connectivity (k = 6.42), followed by UCEC (k = 3.82), and finally UCS (k = 1.23) (Table 1). Further details on GCN construction are provided at http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.by85pzy6 (last accessed November 16, 2021)., Before further investigating these csGCNs, we wanted to analyze the gene expression patterns of the genes within the networks. More specifically, we were interested in determining if the genes within the csGCNs were differentially expressed between each respective cancer condition and GTEx-Normal. A total of 20,242 genes were analyzed for both UCEC and UCS. The differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2_1.30.1 in R 4.0 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html, last updated November 16, 2021). Genes had to have expression values for at least 50 samples for each analysis. In total, 14,551 and 13,898 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the comparison of GTEx-Normal with UCEC and UCS, respectively (adjusted P-value <0.001)., The genes within each GCN were merged with the differential expression analysis to denote the differential expression status of each csGCN gene. Of the 1,496 genes in the UCEC-specific network, 1,333 were differentially expressed, accounting for roughly 89% of the genes. In the UCS-specific network 35 of the 39 genes were differentially expressed, accounting for 90% of the genes. For the UCEC csGCNs, when observing only the DEGs and DEG edges (edges in which both nodes are DEGs), there is a slight increase in k, of which can also be observed in GTEx-Normal. When similarly assessing UCS, k slightly decreases. The csGCNs are represented in Figure 2 (UCEC), Figure 3 (UCS), and Supplementary Figure S1 (GTEx-Normal). In the network visualizations, the genes are represented as blue nodes, and coexpression edges are depicted as gray lines. Furthermore, the text color of each node denotes if the gene is upregulated in cancer (green), downregulated in cancer (red), or was not significantly different between cancer and GTEx-Normal (black). The attributes of each GCN network can be found in Table 1. The complete list of condition-specific edges and each node’s DEG status can be found in Supplementary Table S1., Directed regulatory edges derived from the GTEx database and published by the Glass Lab at Harvard were downloaded (https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/gtex-networks, last updated November 16, 2021). We extracted the uterine regulatory edges and merged them with the coexpression edges in our csGCNs to create condition-specific GRNs (csGRNs). Similar to the GCN construction, the TFs were also subject to the differential expression analysis. Figures 2 and 3 both contain these regulatory edges (denoted as arrowed edges) for UCEC and UCS, respectively. Their regulation pattern in cancer is denoted like that of the genes described above (red: significantly downregulated in cancer; green: significantly upregulated in cancer; black: no significant difference in expression). A summary of the GCN–GRNs can be found in Table 2., Another step we included in GRN assembly was a ratio analysis comparing the expression ratio of the TF to the TR. For each regulatory edge, the TF/TR ratio was compared between GTEx-Normal samples and the respective cancer samples using a Student’s t-test. In Figures 2 and 3, the regulatory edges with significantly different ratios (P-value <1E−5) are shown as orange arrowed edges, and those without a significantly different ratio between normal and cancer conditions are shown as black arrowed edges. More detailed descriptions of these analyses can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.by85pzy6 (last updated November 16, 2021)., Of the 1,101 regulatory edges investigated for the UCEC GRN, 356 had a significantly different TF/TR ratio between GTEx-Normal and UCEC samples and consisted of a TF and TR that were both differentially expressed. Because those edges meet three separate requirements (differentially expressed TF, differentially expressed TR, and significant TF/TR ratio), they will be referred to as “significant” regulatory edges. A summary of the distribution of edges across the four possible expression patterns (TF and TR up, TF and TR down, TF up and TR down, TF down and TR up) can be found in Figure 4. Of the 356 significant edges, 163 had a lower TF expression and higher TR expression in UCEC. The least common TF and TR expression patterns found in the UCEC network was one in which both the TF and TR were both upregulated. In the UCS-specific GRN there were only three regulatory edges that met the significance criteria, none of which had the same TF and TR expression pattern (one TF down and TR up edge, one TF up and TR down edge, one TF and TR down edge). A heatmap visualization with DEG status of TFs and TRs, TF and TR expression pattern in cancer, and designation of significant TF/TR ratios can be seen in Supplementary Figure S2., Expression patterns of transcription factors and target genes in cancer-specific regulatory edges. Distribution of expression patterns and ratio analyses results for regulatory edges in UCEC and UCS networks compared with GTEx., Expression patterns of transcription factors and target genes in cancer-specific regulatory edges. Distribution of expression patterns and ratio analyses results for regulatory edges in UCEC and UCS networks compared with GTEx., Within these csGRNs, we were particularly interested in potential co-regulation relationships, so we selected “triangle” subnetworks for further study. Here, we define a triangle relationship as one in which a TF regulates two TRs that are connected by an csGCN edge. These triangle relationships were extracted from the UCEC GRN to create what we have deemed the “UCEC triangle GRN.” As seen in Figure 5, the UCEC triangle GRN is made up of four TFs and seven genes, almost all of which have a significantly lower expression in UCEC compared with normal, as noted by the red gene names. In this triangle network there is one highly connected core group including genes TSHZ3, GPR124, LDB2, and PDGFRB, and TF NRF1. All the gene pairs within that core group are co-expressed, and NRF1 has a significant TF/TR ratio with each gene. Likely because of its smaller size, no triangle relationships were present in the UCS GRN, so therefore no corresponding triangle GRN was assembled. The attributes of the UCEC triangle GRN can be found in Table 2 and the DNA mutation rates for these genes in UCEC can be found in Supplementary Table S7., Cytoscape visualization of UCEC triangle network. A UCEC-specific triangle network in which transcription factors are associated with both nodes of a coexpression edge., Cytoscape visualization of UCEC triangle network. A UCEC-specific triangle network in which transcription factors are associated with both nodes of a coexpression edge., Functional enrichment was performed for the genes within the UCEC GCN, the UCS GCN, and the UCEC triangle GRN using ToppFun (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp). ToppFun uses a set of genes as input to identify associations of those genes with published annotations, such as microRNAs, phenotypes, and cell types. The DEG list for each csGCN was used as the input, and the default full gene set as the background. The UCEC DEG list (n = 1,333 genes) had 16,305 significant associations (q-val FDR B&H < 1E−5). Several associations of interest included ovarian cancer (q-val FDR B&H = 8.51E−73), endometrial cancer (q-val FDR B&H = 2.39E−54), cervical cancer (q-val FDR B&H = 3.03E−45), and normal endometrial tissue (q-val FDR B&H = 6.56E−43). Functional enrichment of the UCS DEG list (n = 35) yielded four significant associations (q-val FDR B&H < 1E−5), of which included basal lung cells (q-val FDR B&H = 3.46E−6), immune cells (q-val FDR B&H = 3.46E−6), and “genes upregulated in uterus upon knockout of BMP2” (q-val FDR B&H = 6.62E−6). Functional enrichment of the genes within the UCEC triangle GRN was also performed, which yielded 110 significant associations (q-val FDR B&H < 1E−5). These associations included many TCGA cancers, like that of the bladder, stomach, lung, and ovary, as well as mesenchymal cells. The functional enrichment associations for the DEGs within the UCEC, UCS, UCEC triangle, and GTEx networks can be found in Supplementary Table S6., In this study, we constructed uterine condition-specific gene relationship networks where genes are defined by coexpression and regulatory edges. Our csGCN search space was a unified uterine GEM containing cancerous (TCGA-UCEC and TCGA-UCS) and normal (TCGA-Normal and GTEx-Normal) tissue samples. The directed GRN graph was derived from annotated uterine gene regulatory relationships using GTEx-Normal tissue samples. Thus, our final gene relationship graph for uterine derived normal and tumor samples is built from the appropriate tissue., As shown in Figure 1, the global RNA expression profiles for normal and diseased uterine samples segregated due to the overall gene expression patterns, with the exception of one TCGA-UCEC outlier that can be seen in the top left corner of the t-SNE visualization. To identify genetic expression subsystems that discriminate between conditions (i.e., biomarker systems), we assembled csGCNs for two uterine cancers (UCEC and UCS) and normal uterine tissue (GTEx-Normal). The coexpression edges were discovered using KINC, a program that finds gene pairs based on correlations in their expression patterns within each respective condition. TCGA-Normal samples could not be processed through KINC due to the limited number of samples, so therefore, they were excluded from the remaining analyses. To further validate these csGCNs, a differential expression analysis (DESeq2) was used to find coexpression edges that have a significantly different expression pattern between cancer and normal samples. The DESeq2 results can be found in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, a summary of which can be found in Table 1., We then incorporated directed regulatory edges (TF to TR) into each respective GCN to build csGRNs. This was done by adding the regulatory edges into each GCN if the TR was present in the network. In the UCEC GRN, there were several instances where one TF was associated with both nodes of a coexpression edge, a relationship we dubbed a “triangle.” These potential coregulation triangle relationships were extracted, which constitutes another GRN, the UCEC triangle GRN. Finally, we wanted to further investigate these regulatory edges by comparing the TF/TR FPKM ratio for the cancer and normal samples, then use a t-test to determine if the ratios between the two groups were significantly different. This was completed for the regulatory edges in the UCEC, UCS, GTEx, and UCEC triangle GRNs. For the GTEx GRN, the genes and TFs had to be differentially expressed in both UCS and UCEC, and regulatory edges had to have a significantly different TF/TR ratio compared with UCEC and UCS. The regulatory edges with significantly different TF/TR ratios can be seen as orange arrowed edges in Figure 2 (UCEC GRN), Figure 3 (UCS GRN), Figure 5 (UCEC triangle GRN), Supplementary Figure S1 (GTEx GRN) and are documented in Supplementary Table S4 (Cancer GRN edges) and Supplementary Table S5 (GTEx GRN edges)., The UCEC triangle GRN was constructed due to our interest in possible coregulation of csGCN edges. This triangle subnetwork drastically reduced the size of the overall UCEC GRN, allowing us to further investigate these genes of interest. All the genes and TFs in the UCEC triangle GRN are differentially expressed, and all, except ETV3, had a significantly lower expression in UCEC. Five of the seven genes in the UCEC Triangle GRN are not included in the GTEx-Normal GCN, indicating their expression patterns change in UCEC. TMEM119 and CDH11 are the exceptions, each with two coexpression edges in the normal uterine network. Meanwhile all seven genes are highly connected in the UCEC-specific GCN, associated with a total of 106 other genes (mean = 28 edges/gene, median = 20 edges/gene). GPR124 and CDH11 have the highest and lowest connectivity with 66 and 6 coexpression edges, respectively. In the UCEC triangle GRN there are also four TFs, each with varying connectivity across the UCEC and GTEx networks. ETV3 and NRF1 have the highest connectivity, each regulating 13 genes with significant TF/TR ratios. The gene with the lowest number of significant regulatory associations in UCEC was GABPA with seven edges. In the GTEx GRN NRF1 has the most significant associations at 13 genes, while ELK4 has the fewest with four significant associations. It is possible that these changes in coexpression patterns between the UCEC and GTEx-Normal GCNs are due to mutations in the cis or trans DNA sites., In the UCEC triangle GRN there is a highly connected core group composed of TF NRF1 and genes GPR124, LDB2, TSHZ3, and PDGFRB. NRF1 works in cell homeostasis through transcriptional control mechanisms and has previously been implicated in multiple types of cancer (Bhawe and Roy 2018; Yuan et al. 2018). GPR124, a G-protein coupled receptor, is involved in the WNT pathway (Zhou and Nathans 2014). Mutations of other genes in this pathway have been associated with endometrial cancer (Levine 2013). TSHZ3 has been shown to be downregulated in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, similar to our results (Yamamoto et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2021). LDB2 also works in transcriptional regulation and has been found to have a lower expression in liver cancer as well (Yu et al. 2017). PDGRFB was recently associated with TMEM119, another member of the UCEC triangle GRN, and AKT, a previously identified endometrial cancer hub gene, in ovarian cancer (Huo et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2021)., KINC, DESeq2, and the TF/TR ratio analysis have all been completed based on RNA expression values found in the uterine GEM. The Genomic Data Commons Data Portal (GDC) contains information on DNA mutation rate and CNV occurrence rate for the UCEC samples from our analysis, as well as 389 additional samples that have been added since the uterine GEM was created by the Wang Lab. This platform allows for comparison of mutation rates for our genes of interest with other cancer projects, including other TCGA projects. The number of projects that investigated these genes ranges from 21 to 35. Of the 11 nodes (7 genes, 4 TFs) in the UCEC Triangle GRN, nine had the highest mutation rates in TCGA-UCEC. For LDB2 and TMEM119 the highest mutation rate was in TCGA-SKCM, a melanoma study and was followed immediately by TCGA-UCEC. Both genes have been implicated in other cancers, and therefore are not solely specific to endometrial cancer (Yu et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2018). A summary of the DNA mutations rates of these genes can be found in Supplementary Table S7., When investigating the CNV occurrence rate for the UCEC Triangle GRN genes and TFs, UCEC consistently had a lower rate of CNV events at those genes compared with UCS. For example, when investigating TSHZ3 TCGA-UCEC ranked seventh highest in CNV occurrence rate with 60 events out of 510 cases (11.76%), while TCGA-UCS ranked no. 1 with 21 events out of 56 cases (37.5%). While initially we expected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UCEC CNV events to be more common, given they are specific to a UCEC network, this seems to reflect the results in TCGA’s comprehensive UCEC study where UCS samples were significantly more likely to be characterized by CNV events compared with endometrioid samples (Levine 2013). These CNV rates can also be found in Supplementary Table S7., There are several previously reported genes with DNA mutations specific to UCEC including FGFR2, CTNNB1, and POLE (Levine 2013). FGFR2 and CTNNB1 were not included in the final DEG results and had no condition-specific edges. POLE was not considered a DEG in the UCEC vs GTEx-Normal analysis (P-adj = 0.033), but did have coexpression edges with PHF1, ABRACL, SPAG5, STC2, and CMYA5 in the GTEx-Normal GCN. POLE was not present in the UCEC-specific GCN., The TCGA landmark paper also identified several genes specific to UCS with common mutations (Cherniack et al. 2017). These include RB1, ZBTB7B, and U2AF1, each of which was found to be mutated in 4−11% of samples. In our analysis RB1 was found to be differentially expressed in UCS samples (P-adj = 4.32E−5) but did not have any UCS-specific edges. Meanwhile, U2AF1 was not found to be differentially expressed in UCS (P-adj = 6.36E−3). Like the other genes listed above, it is possible that the DNA mutations described in previous literature did not result in a significant difference in the mRNA expression. ZBTB7B was not included in the final differential expression results, due to pre- or postanalysis filtering., Previous studies have found several commonly mutated genes for both UCEC and UCS tumors: TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, FBXW7, and KRAS (Cherniack et al. 2017). Of these six genes, five of them (TP53, PTEN, PPP2R1A, FBXW7, and KRAS) were all found to be differentially expressed in our study. PIK3CA was not included in the final differential expression results. However, when looking between condition-specific networks we only observe a change in gene coexpression patterns for the KRAS gene when comparing UCEC and GTEx samples. In UCEC samples KRAS is co-expressed with CDON and FZD4, while it is co-expressed with TSPAN2 in the GTEx-Normal samples. One possible mechanism that could be attributed to this change is through the association of TFs. However, there were no known TFs that regulate KRAS in the uterus. Instead, the change in the co-expression relationships could be due to the mutation rate, as KRAS is mutated in roughly 25% of UCEC cases (Grossman et al. 2016). Other possibilities include epigenetic modifications, associated microRNAs, or other cellular interactions, which could be investigated in a future study. Regarding the remaining genes listed above, there were no condition-specific edges. While they were differentially expressed between UCS and GTEx-Normal, KINC did not find any changes in gene co-expression relationships between UCS and normal uterine tissue. It is possible that although those genes are relatively more frequently mutated in uterine cancer, there are no changes in the gene expression patterns., Other genes have also been previously identified that had mutations in both UCEC and UCS (Cherniack et al. 2017). These include CDH4, ARID1A, ARHGAP35, SPOP, and PIK3R1. CDH4 was not found to be differentially expressed in UCEC or UCS samples. ARHGAP35 was not found to be differentially expressed in UCS samples and was dropped in pre- or postprocessing for the UCEC differential expression analysis. ARID1A was also absent from the differential analysis results for both UCEC and UCS analyses. SPOP was found to be differentially expressed in both UCS and UCEC samples and had several condition-specific relationships. In UCEC SPOP is coexpressed with TOM1L1 and C2ORF15, and coexpressed with many genes in GTEx-Normal (PPP1R12B, H2AFY, BZW2, TPM3, LRRC59, COPG1, HLF, and EIF4G1). SPOP has no associations of annotated TFs in the uterus, so it is possible that the changes in coexpression edges could be due to the mutations. PIK3R1 has been shown to have mutations in both UCEC and UCS, but more commonly in UCEC (Cherniack et al. 2017). In our study, PIK3R1 was differentially expressed in both UCEC (P-adj = 2.41E−4) and UCS (P-adj = 3.08E−12) but did not have any condition-specific coexpression edges., Uterine cancer is one of the leading cancers among women in the United States. Because of this, we were interested in using bioinformatic tools to investigate the genes and their relationships that differentiate endometrial cancer and UCS from normal uterine tissue. We accomplished this by constructing and investigating GCNs and GRNs for normal and cancerous conditions in the uterus, and validating them using differential expression, functional enrichment, and a ratio analysis of expression data for regulatory relationships. These networks add to the growing knowledge of uterine cancer biomarker systems and help elucidate the altered biological pathways that occur. In addition, we aim to better characterize uterine cancer by pursuing further investigations into the two distinct types of endometrial cancer, specifically endometrioid carcinoma and serous adenocarcinoma. In total we hope this knowledge can be used to better prognose and develop treatments for individuals impacted by these uterine cancers in the future., The Supplementary tables containing full networks are available via figshare: https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.16869645., The authors would like to thank the Glass Lab for their work on tissue-specific regulatory relationships and the Wang Lab for merging GTEx and TCGA data, allowing for the analyses described here.

This high-quality scaffold-level reference genome will provide a useful resource for future population genomic analyses and improve our understanding of Typha hybrid dynamics., Cattails (Typha spp.) are aquatic macrophytes that are essential components of wetlands around the world (reviewed in Bansal et al. 2019). These macrophytes often dominate ecosystems through a combination of rapid growth, large size, and sexual and asexual reproduction (Yeo 1964; Andrews and Pratt 1978; Miller and Fujii 2010). Cattails are vital to many wetlands where they cycle nutrients, provide habitat, and aid in bioremediation (Grosshans 2014; Svedarsky et al. 2016; Bonanno and Cirelli 2017). However, cattails can also dominate wetlands and in recent decades invasive cattails have been identified in numerous regions, often following anthropogenic changes that have altered water cycles and increased nutrient loads in wetlands (reviewed in Zedler and Kercher 2004; Bansal et al. 2019). Invasive cattails often form monotypic stands with deleterious effects on local plants and animals, wetland water cycling, and biogeochemical cycles (Yeo 1964; Grace and Harrison 1986; Farrer and Goldberg 2009; Lawrence et al. 2016)., Typha latifolia is likely the most widespread cattail species, occurring on every continent except Antarctica (Smith 1987). Typha angustifolia is also widespread throughout the temperate northern hemisphere (Grace and Harrison 1986), including North America where it was likely introduced from Europe several centuries ago (Ciotir et al. 2013, 2017). In some regions of sympatry T. latifolia and T. angustifolia interbreed to produce the hybrid Typha × glauca (Grace and Harrison 1986; Ciotir et al. 2017; Bansal et al. 2019). In regions surrounding, the Laurentian Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway in North America, Typha × glauca exhibits heterosis (Bunbury-Blanchette et al. 2015; Zapfe and Freeland 2015), and is more abundant than its parental species (Kirk et al. 2011; Freeland et al. 2013; Pieper et al. 2020). In addition to displacing both parental species, invasive Typha × glauca reduces native plant and invertebrate biodiversity (Tuchman et al. 2009; Lawrence et al. 2016), and alters nutrient cycling and community structure in wetlands (Tuchman et al. 2009; Larkin et al. 2012; Geddes et al. 2014; Lishawa et al. 2014; Lawrence et al. 2017)., Although dominant in some regions of North America, Typha × glauca is uncommon in other regions where the parental species are sympatric, including Europe (Ciotir et al. 2017), eastern Canada (Freeland et al. 2013), and China (Zhou et al. 2016). It is not well understood why hybrids are dominant in some regions but not others, although Tisshaw et al. (2020) suggested that hybrids may be limited in coastal wetlands because they have difficulty germinating in salt-rich environments. In addition, although advanced-generation and back-crossed hybrids have been experimentally generated (Pieper et al. 2017) and identified in natural populations (e.g., Kirk et al. 2011; Freeland et al. 2013; Pieper et al. 2020), it has not been possible to differentiate advanced-generation and backcrossed hybrids based on the small number of species-specific molecular markers that are currently available (Snow et al. 2010; Kirk et al. 2011). Morphology-based assessments are also unreliable due to overlapping phenotypes (Tangen et al. 2021)., A genome-wide suite of SNPs specific to one or the other parent species would greatly facilitate investigations into the dynamics of the Typha × glauca hybrid zone, which is now expanding westwards from the Great Lakes region into the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and the USA (Tangen et al. 2021). Genome characterization would also facilitate investigations into local adaptation, introgression, and hybrid dynamics; this in turn may inform future management of T. latifolia, which is predicted to experience a dramatically reduced distribution following climate change (Xu et al. 2013), likely to the detriment of wetlands throughout its widespread native distribution. Here, we report the genome assembly, annotation, and analysis of T. latifolia, the first fully sequenced species in the family Typhaceae., Leaves of a known T. latifolia plant (Figure 1) were taken from an individual grown at Trent University’s (ON, Canada) greenhouse and ground in liquid nitrogen. DNA was immediately extracted using an E.Z.N.A Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc. GA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions for frozen material and eluted in a final volume of 100 μl. DNA quality was assessed on a Tapestation (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) before being sent to The Centre for Applied Genomics, Toronto, ON, for sequencing. Paired-end reads were sequenced on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeqX system (Illumina, Inc. CA, USA). Long-reads (LR) were sequenced on one SMRT HiFi cell using a PacBio Sequel II system (Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. CA, USA)., Broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia). Photo by Joanna Freeland., Broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia). Photo by Joanna Freeland., Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed from paired-end short reads (SRs) using Trimmomatic -v0.36 (Bolger et al. 2014). The optimal k-mer and genome size from the SRs were estimated using Kmergenie -v1.7051 (Chikhi and Medvedev 2014). We then applied a four-step hybrid assembly: (1) SR assemblies were generated using multiple pipelines: ABySS –v2.2.4 (Jackman et al. 2017) with default settings, 32 threads, a 125 GB total memory; SOAPdenovo2 -r240 (Luo et al. 2012) using default settings, 16 threads, 400 GB of total memory; and Platanus -v1.2.4 (Kajitani et al. 2014) using default settings, 32 threads, a 343 GB memory limit, a total memory of 375 GB. We also downsampled the SR data to 20% because really high coverage can be problematic for de Bruijn graphs (Richards and Murali 2015). The SR assembly with highest quality and completeness was selected by calculating contig N50, total contig length as a percentage of estimated genome size, and the number and percentage of contigs longer than 50 Kb. (2) SR contigs were then aligned to raw LR to create scaffolds using DBG2OLC -v20160205 (options: k 17, AdaptiveTh 0.001, KmerCovTh 2, MinOverlap 20, RemoveChimera 1) (Ye et al. 2016). (3) LR contigs were assembled using Canu –v2.0 (Koren et al. 2017) using the expected genome size inferred from Kmergenie, a maximum memory of 124 GB, and a maximum of 32 threads. And (4) the hybrid assembly (Step 2) was merged with Canu LR contigs (Step 3) using QuickMerge –v0.3.0 (Chakraborty et al. 2016) following the 2-step strategy described by Solares et al. (2018). Pilon –v1.23.0 (Walker et al. 2014) was used to polish the genome by mapping the Illumina SR back to the genome, thereby correcting base errors and small misassemblies. The final assembly was then submitted and assessed for sequencing and assembly artifacts by NCBI., The T. latifolia hybrid genome was assessed for completeness using Benchmarking Universal Single-copy Orthologs (BUSCO) –v3.0.2 (Simão et al. 2015). BUSCOs of the lineage Liliopsida were assessed from OrthoDB release 10 (Waterhouse et al. 2013). We aligned available chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes (Supplementary Table S1) to our assembly using NUCmer -v3.23 (Kurtz et al. 2004) to identify plastid genomes; scaffolds with long matches (>5000 bp) were extracted and further validated on NCBI Blast. Structural and functional annotation was done in the GenSAS -v6.0 annotation pipeline (Humann et al. 2019). We masked interspersed and simple repetitive elements throughout the genome using a database developed through repeat modeler -v2.0.1 (Smit and Hubley 2008–2015) in conjunction with repeat masker -v4.0.7 with the NCBI/rmblast search engine, and quick sensitivity (Smit et al. 2013–2015). The hardmasked version of the genome sequence was used for feature prediction. Available RNA-seq data from T. angustifolia (SRR15541138) were mapped to the genome using hisat2 -v2.1.0 (Kim et al. 2019) and gene prediction with the RNA-seq alignments was performed by the BRAKER2 -v2.1.1 pipeline, which uses Augustus and GeneMark-ET (Lomsadze et al. 2014; Brůna et al. 2021). ncRNA was predicted using tRNAscan-SE -v2.0 (Lowe and Eddy 1997) and Infernal -v1.1.3 (Nawrocki and Eddy 2013). Refinement of the official gene set was performed with an available T. latifolia transcriptome (Moscou 2017) using PASA -v2.3.3 (Haas et al. 2003). Last, our assembly (N50 scaffolds) was aligned and compared to a recent T. latifolia hybrid scaffold assembly (JAAWWQ010000000) using Mummer4 (Marçais et al. 2018) requiring a minimum alignment (l) of 10,000 bp., Single-copy orthologous genes from five other species were identified using OrthoVenn2 with an e-value cutoff of 1e-5, an inflation value of 1.5, and the annotation, protein similarity network, and cluster relationship network enabled (Xu et al. 2019). OrthoVenn2 performs all-against-all genome-wide protein comparisons and groups genes into clusters with the Markov Clustering Algorithm, where a cluster is made up of orthologs and paralogs (Wang et al. 2015). Here we selected Oryza sativa Japonica, Brachypodium distachyon, and Sorghum bicolor from the family Poaceae, and Ananas comosus from the family Bromeliaceae. Arabidopsis thaliana from the Brassicaceae family was chosen as the dicot outgroup. All proteomes were from the Ensemble database release 104 (Howe et al. 2021). The identified orthologous sequences were then aligned using MAFFT -v7.741 (Katoh and Standley 2013) and concatenated into single sequences by species using SeqKit -v0.15.0 (Shen et al. 2016). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using RAxML -v8.2.12 (Stamatakis 2014) with the PROTGAMMAAUTO substitution model (Darriba et al. 2012). The phylogenetic tree divergence times were estimated using MCMCTree from the PAML package -v4.9j (Yang 1997, 2007), and was calibrated using the divergence time between Sorghum and Oryza (42–52 Mya) (Kumar et al. 2017)., A total of 138.6 Gb of raw 151 bp Illumina reads were sequenced (Supplementary Table S2). Quality filtering and trimming removed 6.5 Gb of sequence data. A recommended k-mer size of 101 bp and estimated genome size of 257 Mb was estimated from the short-read data (Supplementary Figure S1). LR data from the Pacbio Sequel II generated 86.8 Gb of raw data: this included 7,244,218 subreads with a mean length of 11,978.2 bp. All sequencing reads were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession No PRJNA751759). The ABySS assembly that used 100% of Illumina reads had the most contiguous genome and was used for the assembly (Supplementary Table S3). This AbySS SR assembly had a N50 of 0.011 Mb, 365,565 contigs, and 362 contigs longer than 50 Kb (Supplementary Table S3). The DBG2OLC assemblies (ABySS contigs + raw long reads) improved the assembly statistics but resulted in a smaller than expected genome (Table 1); here we calculated N50 of 0.132 Mb, 1840 contigs, and 1445 contigs longer than 50 Kb (Supplementary Table S4). The LR Canu assembly had an N50 of 8.706 Mb, and contained 1189 contigs, 821 of which were longer than 50 Kb (95.54%) (Table 1). The final merged and polished hybrid genome assembly—DGB2OLC assembly 1 + Canu—was 286.7 Mb with plastids removed. We estimated an N50 of 8.71 Mb, and consisted of 1158 scaffolds (Table 1). Step 4 resulted in the merger of three scaffolds and the subsequent removal of 30 short scaffolds by NCBI vetting. The GC content was 38.05% (Table 1). The polished genome has been deposited in the NCBI genome database (JAIOKV000000000). We observed a high degree of synteny between our alignment and similar hybrid assembly of T. latifolia (Supplementary Figure S2), although mapping success of unrelated individuals was significantly higher in our genome (Supplementary Figure S3)., Genome assembly statistics of our four-step hybrid assembly, Short read (SR) contig assembly consists of contigs assembled from 100% of the Illumina reads using the ABySS assembler. The DBG2OLC assembler combined the 100% ABySS contigs and PacBio long reads. The long read (LR) contig assembly was generated from only PacBio long reads using Canu.

The merged polished scaffolds are from merging the DBG2OLC assembly and LR contigs and were polished using Pilon., Approximately 96.03% of BUSCOs were identified (3148 of 3278) in the assembly. Of these, 3025 BUSCOs were complete (92.28%), and 123 were fragmented. Of the complete BUSCOs, 2461 were single-copies, and 564 had duplicates. Repeats represented 43.84% of the genome (see breakdown in Figure 2). The chloroplast genome was detected and split on two scaffolds, while the entire mitochondrial genome appeared to be assembled (Supplementary Table S5). Total repeat content of the genome is consistent with other Poales genomes (Kawahara et al. 2013; Ming et al. 2015; Redwan et al. 2016): long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) comprised 1.22% of the genome, while short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) were not detected in the genome (Table 2). The annotation pipeline produced 27,432 genes, which coded for 34,911 proteins and 34,974 mRNA sequences. 2095 rRNA, 502 tRNA, and 214 miRNA sequences were putatively identified, which are similar to sequence counts in related plants (Supplementary Table S6).

Only the numbers of ortholog clusters of adjacent species, those common to all species, and those unique to each species are labeled., Summary of repeats masked in the Typha latifolia genome, Summary of repeats masked in the Typha latifolia genome, Ortholog clustering analysis revealed 9168 gene families were shared among T. latifolia, A. comosus, A. thaliana, B. distachyon, O. sativa, and S. bicolor (Figure 2). In total, 1806 gene families were found to be unique to T.latifolia (Figure 2). We aligned 1900 single-copy gene clusters to conduct phylogenomic analysis (Figure 3). The phylogenomic tree generated supports a divergent Typha position in Poales (Figure 3), with Typha forming a separate clade with pineapples (A.comosus). We estimated the bromeliad lineage (Typha-Ananas) to be approximately 70 million years old., Phylogenetic tree with divergence times, based on the alignment of 1900 single-copy gene clusters.

Ninety-five percent credible divergence times are shown as blue bars and were estimated using MCMCTree. Divergence times and bootstrap values are shown above and below the nodes, respectively. The yellow dot indicates the calibration point., The Typhaceae family (order Poales) is diverse, comprising over 50 recognized species (Christenhusz and Byng 2016). Species in this family are essential components of marshes and wetlands around the world (reviewed in Bansal et al. 2019), and play a role in both bioremediation and the production of biofuel material (Grosshans 2014; Svedarsky et al. 2016; Bonanno and Cirelli 2017). This is the first published whole-genome assembly from a member of the Typhaceae family and adds to the previously characterized chloroplast genome sequences of T.latifolia, T. orientalis, and Sparganium stoloniferum (Guisinger et al. 2010; Su et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020). The assembly and annotation of the Cattail genome, which we note was a key recommendation from a diverse team of Typha researchers (Bansal et al. 2019), will likely be an important tool in wetland management., We explored a variety of SR assemblers given the varying quality of outputs seen in Assemblathon metrics (Bradnam et al. 2013). Of the three SR assemblers used, ABySS produced longer, fewer contigs and scaffolds, which is consistent with previous comparisons (Bradnam et al. 2013). ABySS’ de Bruijn approach did not have issues with the high coverage Illumina data (e.g., Richards and Murali 2015). We combined with SR assembly with raw long read data using DGB2OLC (Ye et al. 2016) as previous plant genomes with similar data showed promising assembly statistics (i.e., Daccord et al. 2017; Hatakeyama et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2019). The long reads in the DBG2OLC assembly captured more lengthy and repetitive regions, resulting in a sharp rise in contig N50 and contigs 50 Kb or longer (Table 1). However, the backbone of the final assembly was the PacBio Canu assembly (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4), with the benefit of this strategy being the removal of chimeras with polished assemblies having very low error rates (Ye et al. 2016)., Accurate genomes are important as sequencing errors can affect both nucleotide diversity and the discovery of markers (Clark and Whittam 1992). LR sequencing further facilitates detection of structural variants (Amarasinghe et al. 2020), which might be useful in studying Typha dynamics given the link to hybridization and speciation (Weissensteiner et al. 2020). The final assembly consists of only 1158 scaffolds, with ~95% being 50 Kb or longer; T. latifolia possessed higher N50 and fewer scaffolds compared to other plant genome assemblies that used PacBio sequencing and similar hybrid assembly pipelines (Redwan et al. 2016; Hatakeyama et al. 2018; Reuscher et al. 2018). With 96.03% of BUSCOs detected and 92.28% of them complete in our assembly, this would suggest a high-quality annotation. The topology of the phylogenomic tree that we reconstructed based on whole-genome sequences of six species agrees with previously inferred evolutionary relationships (e.g., Darshetkar et al. 2019) by grouping together the two bromeliad species (T. latifolia and A. comosus) and the three graminid species (O. sativa, S. bicolor, and B. distachyon), and by inferring a more recent divergence date for graminids compared to bromeliads. Our estimated Typha lineage age of approximately 70 million years exceeds an earlier estimate of between 22.64 and 57.60 mya that was based on seven cpDNA markers (Zhou et al. 2018), although is comparable to the estimate of 69.5 Myr that was based on a combination of fossil records and cpDNA sequences (Bremer 2000). We acknowledge that the use of whole-genome sequences to infer divergence times is still in its infancy, and caution that factors such as rate heterogeneity may complicate such inferences (reviewed in Smith et al. 2018)., The T. latifolia reference genome now allows for studying Typha and hybridization at the molecular level, for example, by providing insight into the adaptation of T. latifolia populations that may be threatened by climate change, and facilitating research into potentially important processes such as hybrid breakdown in invasive Typha hybrids. In addition, genome-wide markers could provide insight into why the hybrid Typha × glauca is dominant in some areas (Kirk et al. 2011; Freeland et al. 2013) but uncommon in others (Freeland et al. 2013; Ciotir et al. 2017). For example, T. angustifolia in North America is thought to have arrived from Europe several centuries ago (Ciotir et al. 2013), and ancestry assessments could test the hypothesis that historical interspecific hybridization led to genetic introgression into some T. angustifolia populations, which may help to explain regional erosion of species barriers. Locus-specific ancestry estimation analyses, markers, and the identification of potentially adaptive genes can all now be used to find evidence of ancient hybridization in T. angustifolia (Goulet et al. 2017; Taylor and Larson 2019). This high-quality draft genome and its comparisons with Poales species will be an indispensable resource for ongoing research into Typha, a genus that both sustains and threatens wetlands around the world., Raw sequencing data can be found in the SR Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA751759.

We demonstrate that genetic mapping based on genotypes imputed using PHG identifies SNPs with a broader range of effect sizes that together explain a higher proportion of genetic variance for heading date and meiotic crossover rate compared to previous studies., For the last 10,000 years, intensive selection of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, created varieties adapted to diverse environments and cultivation practices (Balfourier et al. 2019; He et al. 2019; Walkowiak et al. 2020). Recent advances in crop genomics and the availability of reference genomes have accelerated the adoption of sequence-based genotyping technologies for studying the genetics of agronomic traits (Nyine et al. 2019) and local adaptation (He et al. 2019; Juliana et al. 2019, 2020) and facilitated the introduction of genomics-assisted breeding strategies into wheat improvement pipelines (Poland and Rife 2012; Isidro et al. 2015). However, the limited genome coverage provided by these genotyping technologies does not support the exploration of the entire range of genetic effects conferred by all variants, limiting the utility of the developed genomic diversity and functional genomics resources for understanding genome-to-phenome connections., The large size (17 Gb) and complexity of the wheat genome present a substantial challenge for sequence-based analysis of genetic diversity. Alignment of short sequence reads to the wheat genome is complicated by high levels of sequence redundancy resulting from two rounds of recent whole genome duplication (IWGSC 2018), and the recent propagation of transposable elements comprising nearly 90% of the genome (Wicker et al. 2018). Therefore, the efforts of the wheat research community were focused primarily on sequencing complexity-reduced genomic libraries produced by either enzymatic digests or by targeted sequence capture. These efforts have resulted in a detailed description of the population-scale haplotypic diversity in the low-copy genomic regions in large sets of genetically and geographically diverse wheat lines and breeding populations (He et al. 2019; Juliana et al. 2019; Pont et al. 2019). While these resources have been useful for genotype imputation in populations genotyped using either SNP-based arrays or genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods (Jordan et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2017; Juliana et al. 2019; Nyine et al. 2019), the relatively small number of shared markers between the reference and inference populations limits the number of imputed genotypes, thus diminishing the utility of genotype imputation in wheat genetic studies and breeding., High-quality reference genomes and a reduction in the cost of sequencing presented opportunities for the characterization of genetic diversity by direct sequencing of either whole genomes or genomic regions targeted by sequence capture (Malmberg et al. 2018; He et al. 2019; Walkowiak et al. 2020). While these sequence-based genotyping approaches generate unbiased information about the genetic variants of various frequency classes and genomic locations, large-scale population sequencing of species with large genomes, including many important agricultural crops, remains costly. This issue has been addressed by combining low-coverage sequencing of whole genomes with the prediction of missing genotypes using imputation tools, thereby increasing the power of association mapping and facilitating the detection of causal variants (Davies et al. 2016; Das et al. 2018; Rubinacci et al. 2021)., Recently, a novel strategy referred to as Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) was proposed to improve the efficiency of sequence-based genotyping data storage and imputing genotypes in low-coverage sequencing datasets (Jensen et al. 2020; Valdes Franco et al. 2020). The PHG is capable of storing sequencing data generated using diverse genotyping technologies as a graph of haplotypes of founder lines and is used for predicting missing genotypes in populations characterized by various sequence- or array-based genotyping strategies. By reducing the constraints associated with large-scale sequencing data storage, processing, and utilization, this tool is another step toward leveraging the existing community-generated genomic diversity resources in breeding and research applications. We used skim-seq, whole-exome capture, GBS, and array-based genotyping datasets generated by the USDA-NIFA WheatCAP to develop a Wheat PHG database and evaluate its performance for genotype imputation in wheat lines of different levels of relatedness and different depths of genome coverage., The purpose of this paper is to assess the practicality and effectiveness of imputation using the Practical Haploytpe Graph (PHG) database tool in allohexaploid wheat with the complex genome. Our study combines five datasets that were created using different sequencing approaches. A summary table describing the datasets and their usage is provided in Supplementary Table S1., The primary dataset used in this study includes 65 wheat accessions and breeding lines that were subjected to whole exome capture as part of the WheatCAP, henceforth referred to as WC65. Many of these lines are used as parents in the US university/academia-associated wheat breeding programs, and information about these lines is found in Supplementary Table S2., DNA was extracted from the leaves of 2-week seedlings grown under greenhouse conditions. DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified with Picogreen (Sage Scientific) and wheat exome capture was performed on each sample targeting the non-redundant low-copy portion of the genome. Briefly, wheat exome captures designed in collaboration with Nimblegen targeted 170 Mb of sequence covering about 80,000 transcripts (Krasileva et al. 2017). The barcoded genomic libraries were pooled at 12- or 96-plex levels, and sequenced on NextSeq (Kansas State University (KSU) Integrated Genomics Facility) and/or NovaSeq (Kansas University Medical Center) instrumentation using 2 × 150 bp read runs to produce sequence data providing about 30× coverage of the exome capture target space., The quality of sequence reads was assessed using NGSQC toolkit v.2.3.3 (Patel and Jain 2012). The sequence reads were aligned to the wheat reference genome RefSeq v.1.1 (IWGSC 2018) using HISAT2 (Kim et al. 2015) retaining only uniquely mapped reads. The resulting alignments were processed using the GATK pipeline (McKenna et al. 2010) to generate a genome variant call file (g.vcf format) for each accession. These g.vcf files were used to populate the PHG database (see below). The PHG pipeline exported a variant call file (.vcf format), containing 1,473,670 variable sites, which was subsequently used for diversity analyses, and to assess the accuracy of imputation using both the PHG and Beagle5.0 (see below)., Diversity statistics (π and Tajima’s D) were calculated using TASSEL v5.2.65 (Bradbury et al. 2007) in sliding windows of 2000 SNPs per window stepping 1000 SNPs at a time. The identity-by-descent (IBD) segments were identified using Beagle v.4.1 with the default parameters (Browning and Browning 2013), and considered to be significant at LOD ≥ 3.0. Overlap between the IBD segments was determined using the MultiIntersectBed tool of the Bedtools suite v.2.26.0 (Quinlan and Hall 2010). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was determined using PLINK v.1.90b3.45 (Purcell et al. 2007) by calculating the squared correlation coefficient r2 for all possible pairwise combinations of SNP sites from the same chromosomes., The second dataset used in our study includes another set of US breeding lines subjected to exome capture at KSU Integrated Genomics Facility. Information about these lines is found in Supplementary Table S2. This dataset was used to test the imputation efficiency and accuracy of the PHG database at reduced genome coverage depths., DNA was extracted from leaf tissue as stated above for the WC65. The samples were subjected to whole exome capture and sequenced on the NovaSeq (Kansas University Medical Center) platform using 2 × 150 bp read runs, generating ∼30× depth of coverage., To assess the effect of genome coverage depth on imputation accuracy, we used seqtk (Li 2012) to generate three distinct down-sampled datasets from the 170 Mb wheat exome capture data to mimic 0.01× [5,667 paired-end (PE) reads per accession], 0.1× (56,667 PE per accession), and 0.5× (283,333 PE reads per accession) depth of coverage for the DS75 breeding lines (Supplementary Table S2). This set of DS75 breeding lines included four lines (Duster, Overley, NuPlains, and Zenda), which were also used to build the PHG database, and were part of the WC65 dataset. For each low-coverage level, fastq files of the DS75 accessions were run through the PHG imputation pipeline step (see PHG imputation below)., To impute using Beagle5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013) at low-coverage levels (0.1× and 0.01×), fastq files of the DS75 accessions were aligned to the wheat reference genome RefSeq v.1.1 (IWGSC 2018) using HISAT2 (Kim et al. 2015) retaining only uniquely mapped reads. The resulting alignments were processed using the GATK pipeline (McKenna et al. 2010) and combined to produce a vcf file at each coverage level, which were used as the target files for Beagle imputation. Imputation of the DS75 target panel was run using Beagle5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013) with a window size of 75 Mb and overlap size of 5 Mb, and the WC65 variant data was used as the reference panel. The imputed genotypes in the DS75 data generated using Beagle5.0 and PHG were compared at each coverage level., To test the accuracy of imputation in the low-coverage datasets from DS75, high coverage exome capture data generated for DS75 accessions were used to select a HQ-SNP dataset. The ∼30× exome capture sequenced reads were aligned to RefSeq v.1.1 (IWGSC 2018) and variants called using the approaches described above for the WC65 dataset. The raw GATK pipeline SNPs were filtered using bcftools (Danecek et al. 2021) retain variants with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.015 and missing data < 10%. Filtered GATK variants were combined with the 90K genotyping data (Wang et al. 2014), producing high-quality filtered variants (henceforth, HQ-SNPs) that were used for assessing the accuracy of the imputation for each accession., The concordance of imputed genotypes was assessed in relation to the HQ-SNPs using a custom Perl script. The script compares the SNP positions and alleles between the imputed and HQ-SNP datasets for each accession, and divides the number of matching genotype calls by the total number of overlapped genotype calls. On average, the estimates of accuracy were based on nearly 550,000 genotype calls per accession for DS75. The imputation accuracy in DS75 between the Beagle v.5.0 and PHG imputation methods for 0.01× and 0.1× coverage levels was compared using a paired t-test. At each coverage level, PHG imputation was more accurate (0.01×: t = 9.59, P-value = 1.9 × 10−14; 0.1×: t = 19.06, P-value = 2.0 × 10−16) than Beagle imputation. Imputation accuracy comparisons between genomes and SNPs with different minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were performed using ANOVA from car and lme4 R packages., A GBS sequencing dataset using MspI-PstI digested DNA of 70 wheat accessions were sequenced using GBS and whole exome capture, to check imputation accuracy on an independent GBS dataset (Supplementary Table S2). These lines were not included into the PHG database construction. An in silico digestion of wheat genome RefSeq v.1.0 detected nearly 3 million PstI recognition sites, of which 1.96 million are located within 250 bp of an MspI recognition site (Bernardo et al. 2020), and given GBS sequencing read lengths are 100 bp, we estimate the target size of GBS sequencing is 196 Mb. The majority (52 accessions) of these accessions were sequenced at 2.5× coverage, while 18 accessions were sequenced at a slightly lower coverage depth (∼1× target space), providing a chance to compare PHG imputation using GBS sequencing data providing different coverage depths of targeted sites., Raw fastq files (1 × 100 bp) were quality filtered, separated by barcode, and barcodes trimmed from reads, as described (Jordan et al. 2018). Trimmed fastq files were processed using the PHG imputation pipeline (see PHG imputation below)., The accuracy of PHG imputation was assessed by calculating concordance between imputed genotypes and genotypes from the HQ-SNP dataset. On average, the estimates of accuracy were based on nearly 550,000 genotype calls per accession for GBS70., Previously generated GBS data (Jordan et al. 2018) based on MseI-PstI-digested DNA (Saintenac et al. 2013) from the wheat nested association mapping (NAM) population were used to test the imputation accuracy of the Wheat PHG. This dataset includes 2100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that represent a population of 28 families of 75 RILs each. The common parent, Berkut, and three other NAM parental lines, including Dharwar Dry, PBW343, and PI382150 (Supplementary Table S2), were used in the PHG construction., Fastq files (1 × 100 bp) were processed as previously described (Jordan et al. 2018). On average, our dataset included 1.85 million reads per accession, corresponding to ∼1× coverage of the PstI-MseI sites in the reference wheat genome. The fastq files were processed using the PHG imputation pipeline (see below)., The concordance of imputed genotypes from the PHG pipeline was assessed by comparing with the previously reported, high-quality 90K iSelect genotyping data (Wang et al. 2014) generated for the NAM population, and high-quality SNPs identified in the NAM population. These high-quality SNPs were identified using the same procedures applied for the DS75 lines, except for including a post-GATK filtering step that retained only those SNPs that segregate among the NAM parents, and have MAF > 0.015 (henceforth, HQ-NAM SNPs). On average, the estimates of accuracy in the NAMgbs dataset were based on nearly 5000 genotype calls per accession. The comparisons of the imputation accuracy between families where both parents were used to construct the PHG database and families with only one parent represented in the PHG database were performed using ANOVA., Genomic libraries of low-coverage whole-genome skim sequencing (Malmberg et al. 2018) were prepared for 24 samples (Supplementary Table S2) from one of the NAM families (Jordan et al. 2018) using Illumina DNA Prep Kit along with the Illumina’s Nextera CD adapters. Sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed on the Illumina NextSeq platform (Kansas State University, Integrated Genomics Facility) for an average of 6.1 million PE reads per accession, which represents ∼0.1× genome coverage., Demultiplexed fastq files were quality trimmed and used for PHG imputation (see PHG imputation below). The accuracy of PHG imputation was assessed by calculating the concordance of imputed genotypes and genotypes from the HQ-NAM dataset. On average, the estimates of accuracy were based on nearly 5000 genotype calls per accession. Paired t-tests were used to compare the imputation accuracy between NAMgbs and NAMskim for matching accessions., The Wheat PHG database was built using PHG version 0.017. Instructions for creating the PHG along with source code are located with the PHG wiki: https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/practicalhaplotypegraph/wiki/Home. The approaches and parameters for constructing the Wheat PHG were discussed and developed during two PHG workshops organized at Cornell University. The first step of the PHG database construction is to create reference ranges for data storage and variant imputation (Supplementary Figure S1). In this case, “informative” reference ranges were chosen by extending the high confidence gene model coordinates from Chinese Spring RefSeq v.1.1 (IWGSC 2018) 500 bp in each direction. Adjacent ranges were merged if the boundaries lie within 500 bp from each other. This resulted in a final set of 106,484 informative reference ranges across the RefSeq v.1.1, while the remaining intergenic ranges were considered less informative due to abundance of repetitive sequences (Supplementary Figure S1)., The second PHG construction step populates the database with sequence data from diverse accessions across the reference ranges (Supplementary Figure S1). Pre-processed exome capture g.vcf files for the WC65 accessions, including 58 T. aestivum accessions, three Aegilops tauschii accessions, three Triticum turgidum subsp. durum wheat cultivars, and one T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum accession (Supplementary Table S2) generated by GATK (McKenna et al. 2010) were loaded into the PHG, creating a database of 6,705,472 haplotypes. This set of haplotypes should be representative of the haplotypic diversity in the wheat breeding programs within the United States., The third PHG construction step creates consensus haplotypes for the reference ranges, using the diversity data from the WC65 accessions (Supplementary Figure S1). This step collapses the raw haplotypes into consensus haplotypes using a user-defined maximum divergence (mxDiv) parameter, which was set to 0.0001 for wheat. This parameter results in the clustering of raw haplotypes that contain <1 variant within 10,000 bp into a common haplotype. The value of the mxDiv parameter was based on prior diversity estimates in wheat (Akhunov et al. 2010; Jordan et al. 2015), and aimed at retaining a manageable number of haplotypes per reference range as described in Jensen et al. (2020). In addition to the mxDiv parameter, we set minTaxa = 1, which retains haplotypes present in only one accession and facilitates the imputation of rare haplotypes. Using these parameters, a total of 712,733 consensus haplotypes were detected, which is approximately 6.7 haplotypes per informative reference range, similar to ∼5 haplotypes per reference range reported in the sorghum PHG (Jensen et al. 2020)., For imputation using PHG, low coverage sequence data (fastq) was aligned to the consensus haplotypes stored in the PHG database (Supplementary Figure S1) using minmap2 (Li 2018) program. A Hidden Markov model was used to infer the paths through the PHG that match the mapped reads while determining the missing haplotypes. The variants were imputed using the haplotype structure stored in the database, and exported as a vcf file. By using minReads = 0 parameter, variant calls were imputed for all variable positions in the Wheat PHG database. The resulting vcf file for the imputed genotypes were compared to high quality variant information for imputation accuracy as described above for each dataset., A Wheat PHG database was created using whole-exome capture data from a set of 65 wheat accessions, WC65 (Supplementary Table S2) contributed by the major US wheat breeding programs and the parental lines used for the genetic analyses of the yield component traits in WheatCAP (www.triticeaecap.org). This set of accessions was selected from a larger panel of nearly 250 wheat cultivars assembled in coordination with the US wheat breeding programs to build a genomic resource to be used as a reference panel for genotype imputation. This diverse set of 65 accessions is comprised of mostly spring and winter bread wheat cultivars, but it also included three accessions of the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, A. tauschii (accessions TA1615, TA1718, and TA1662/PI603230), and four accessions of tetraploid wheat (three T. turgidum subsp. durum wheat cultivars Langdon, Ben, and Mountrail and one domesticated emmer, T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum, accession PI41025)., For constructing the PHG, the wheat genome was split into a set of informative reference ranges that represent the high confidence gene models in the IWGSC RefSeq v.1.1 (IWGSC 2018). By using the predicted gene models to define reference ranges, we aimed to reduce the impact of erroneous genotype calling associated with the misalignments of sequence reads to the repetitive portion of the wheat genome (Wicker et al. 2018) on the estimation of LD and detecting haplotype blocks. A total of 106,484 reference ranges spanning all 21 chromosomes were defined (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S3), with an average of 5,070 reference ranges per chromosome; chromosome 4D contains the lowest (3,612 ranges) and chromosome 2B harbors the highest (6,221 ranges) number of reference ranges., Using the WC65 accessions to populate the Wheat PHG database, we discovered 1,473,670 SNPs and small-scale indels across the 106,484 reference ranges, of which 1,457,321 are high quality, bi-allelic SNPs (Supplementary Table S3). The inclusion of three diploid A. tauschii accessions into the panel increased the number of variable sites detected in the D genome lineage, which is the least polymorphic genome in bread wheat (Wang et al. 2013; Jordan et al. 2015; He et al. 2019). Excluding the variants from A. tauschii, we found that 161,226 (31%) sites in the D genome were monomorphic among the bread wheat cultivars. Similarly, we found that 31,486 SNPs (7%) in the A genome and 32,228 SNPs (6%) in the B genome are contributed by the domesticated emmer and durum lines, and are monomorphic in hexaploid wheat. These private SNPs explain the high levels of divergence between the domesticated emmer and A. tauschii accessions from the hexaploid wheat lines (Figure 1A). The patterns of genetic diversity and allele frequency distribution in the D genome compared to those in the A and B genomes were consistent with the known population bottleneck cased by polyploidization (Table 1): (1) diversity mean estimates for the D genome were <2.3-fold that of the A and B genomes (πD = 0.076, πA = 0.175, and πB = 0.182; Table 1), (2) the estimates of Tajima’s D were lower in the D genome than in the A and B genomes (Tajima’s DD = –2.19, Tajima’s DA = –0.67, and Tajima’s DB = –0.55, Table 1), (3) the mean MAFs were greater in the A and B genomes than in the D genome (MAFA = 0.12, MAFB = 0.12, and MAFD = 0.05), and (4) LD drops to half of its initial value (r2 ≤ 0.33) at 20 Mb in the D genome, whereas in the A and B genomes LD drops to the same level at 12 and 10 Mb, respectively (Table 1, Figure 1B)., Genetic diversity of WC65 accessions of wheat and its diploid and tetraploid relatives used for developing the Wheat PHG.

For each WheatCAP parental line included in the Wheat PHG, we estimated the length of genomic segments sharing IBD with other lines in the panel. On average, the pairs of parents had 451 Mb (∼3%) of IBD segments (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting distant relationships among the WheatCAP parental lines. This result was consistent with the high correlation (r = 0.64) observed between the genetic distance and IBD. However, the estimates of the total length of IBD segments among cultivars were quite variable (Figure 1C). For example, in cultivars Prosper from North Dakota and Shelly from Minnesota, the length of shared IBD segments was nearly 1.29 Gb (8.6%), whereas hard winter wheat cultivars Lyman (South Dakota) and Overley (Kansas) shared only 128 Mb (0.85%) of IBD segments. The average length of IBD segments shared by the distantly related durum wheat and domesticated emmer parents was only 57.6 Mb. Across all breeding programs, we detected 556 regions sharing IBD, with an average IBD segment length of 12.2 Mb. Over half (53%) of the IBD segments overlapped with a segment from at least one other breeding program, translating to more than 1.68 Gb of the genome shared between any two wheat breeding programs. This estimate includes 1.49 Gb of shared IBD in the D genome (89%), while only 86.4 Mb and 105.7 Mb of IBD with other breeding programs were detected in the A and B genomes, respectively. The genomic segments sharing IBD with most of the wheat lines were located on chromosomes 7D (568–571 Mb) and 3D (496.6–505 Mb), which were common to seven breeding programs., The WC65 dataset included 21 hard red winter wheat cultivars from the US Great Plains region (Supplementary Table S2). Pairwise comparisons among these lines showed that, on average, they share 416 Mb of IBD segments, with an average IBD segment length of 13 Mb, and nearly 83% of all shared IBD regions are located in the D genome (Supplementary Table S5). This finding is consistent with the lack of diversity among breeding lines in the D genome (Chao et al. 2010) and the high levels of shared ancestry among the lines from the US Great Plains’ breeding programs., We used several low-coverage sequencing datasets to assess the imputation performance of the Wheat PHG (Supplementary Table S2). First, we used a set of 75 spring and winter wheat lines, DS75, from the US wheat breeding programs sequenced using the whole-exome capture approach (Krasileva et al. 2017; He et al. 2019) to mimic a low-coverage sequencing experiment. We down-sampled the raw unmapped Illumina PE reads generated for each accession to create datasets with three levels of sequence coverage depths (0.01×, 0.1×, and 0.5×) for the regions targeted by the exome capture assay. The accuracy of imputation achieved using the Wheat PHG was estimated by comparing the concordance of imputed genotype calls with the genotype calls from the HQ-SNP set generated using the 90K iSelect array (Wang et al. 2014) and the high-coverage (20–30× coverage) exome sequencing., On average, using 0.5× coverage of DS75, we achieved 96.6% imputation accuracy, ranging from 95% to 98% among lines (Figure 2A, Table 2). Five- and 50-fold reduction in the depth of read coverage for DS75 did not result in a substantial reduction in the accuracy of imputation. The mean accuracy of PHG imputation was 95.7% (93–98% range) with 0.1× coverage depth, and 91.7% (87–98% range) with as little as 0.01× coverage depth (Figure 2A, Table 2). These results suggest that the imputation method in the PHG could effectively use 0.01× exome coverage data to adequately capture the haplotypic diversity of the DS75 panel to achieve ∼92% imputation accuracy. The imputation accuracy of DS75 varied among the wheat genomes, likely due to genome-specific differences in the extent of LD and haplotypic diversity (Jordan et al. 2015). At 0.01× coverage depth, the accuracy of genotype imputation in the D genome was 95.3%, which was 5% and 5.4% more accurate [P-value(ANOVA) < 2 × 10−16] than imputation in the A (90.3%) and the B genomes (89.9%), respectively (Table 3; Figure 2B)., The accuracy of imputation using the Wheat PHG.

(B) Accuracy of imputation using GBS sequencing at different coverage levels and different database haplotype representation. (C) Accuracy of imputation for alleles with different minor allele frequency for matched samples using GBS and skim-sequencing, n = 24., We compared the performance of the Wheat PHG to one of the commonly used low-coverage imputation methods implemented in Beagle5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013). For this purpose, the WC65 panel of accessions included into the Wheat PHG database was used as the reference panel, and an independent set of DS75 wheat cultivars from the US wheat breeding programs was used as the inference panel. Overall, Beagle imputed missing genotypes with 88.3% accuracy for DS75 at 0.01× coverage (ranging from 76% to 94%), and 92.1% (ranging from 84% to 95%) at 0.1× coverage (Figure 2A, Table 2). Direct comparisons of imputation methods show PHG imputation statistically outperformed Beagle imputation by > 3.4% at both coverage levels [P-value 0.1×(t-test) = 2.0 × 10−16; P-value 0.01×(t-test) = 1.9 × 10−14)., Similar to the imputation of DS75 with PHG, Beagle imputed the D genome with higher accuracy [94.6%; P-value (ANOVA) < 2 × 10−16] than both the A (85.4%) and B (85.5%) genomes (Table 3). The higher extent of LD in the D genome appears to contribute to more accurate genotype imputation compared to that in the A and B genomes using exome capture data, which show faster rates of LD decay and lower proportions of the genome sharing IBD segments in the panel used to build the PHG database., We compared PHG imputation performance for four cultivars (Duster, Overley, NuPlains, and Zenda) in the DS75 panel that were included in PHG database construction, with respect to the other 71 accessions not included in the database construction, and found the four cultivar’s imputation accuracy was statistically higher (ANOVA for different levels of sequence coverage: P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
value 0.5× = 0.0008; P-value 0.1× = 9.2 × 10−5; P-value 0.1× = 3.8 × 10−6) than for other cultivars at all levels of sequence coverage (Supplementary Figure S2a). No similar relationship between the presence of specific haplotypes in the reference panel and imputation accuracy was observed for Beagle. We further explored this relationship by analyzing genotype imputation results in the cultivar Jagger, which showed a substantial reduction in imputation accuracy in the low sequence coverage datasets (0.1× and 0.01× coverage) imputed using Beagle (Supplementary Figure S2a). We assumed that one of the likely factors contributing to the decreased imputation performance of Beagle in the cultivar Jagger was the presence of the wild-relative introgression from Aegilops ventricosa on chromosome 2A (Cruz et al. 2016). Because cultivar Overley, which was used to build the PHG database, also carries this A. ventricosa introgression (Cruz et al. 2016), we could evaluate the impact of the presence of the rare introgressed haplotype in both the PHG database and the Beagle’s reference panel on imputation accuracy. The chromosome-by-chromosome assessment of imputation accuracy for cv. Jagger in the 0.01× coverage dataset showed modest accuracy (90%) for chromosome 2A using PHG. However, for the same chromosome, the imputation accuracy of Beagle reached only 63% (Supplementary Figure S2b). The accuracy of Beagle imputation was also low for other chromosomes (2D, 6A, 7A) (Supplementary Figure S2b), which suggests that cv. Jagger likely carries other regions with unique haplotypes (Kippes et al. 2018; Walkowiak et al. 2020) poorly represented in the reference set used for Beagle imputation. For the same three chromosomes, the accuracy of PHG imputation was higher than that obtained using Beagle., To this point, we tested the imputation accuracy using the same type of genomic data (whole-exome capture) as was used to populate the PHG database. We also evaluated the utility of the developed PHG database for imputing genotypes using two cost-effective complexity-reduced sequencing approaches, GBS (Elshire et al. 2011; Saintenac et al. 2013) and whole-genome skim-seq (Malmberg et al. 2018). We imputed a population of 70 independent accessions (GBS70) that were sequenced with GBS technology, to check imputation accuracy using sequencing reads derived from part of the genome that are not necessarily representative of the reference ranges in the database. Within the GBS70 accessions are 18 accessions that were sequenced at ∼1× the GBS target space and 52 sequenced 2.5× GBS target space. As anticipated, an increase in coverage increased imputation accuracy by 1.7% using GBS sequencing [Figure 2B, P-value (ANOVA) < 4.2 × 10−09]. However, the imputation accuracy of 2.5× coverage GBS reads, which represents nearly 500× more sequencing reads per sample than DS75 at 0.01× was still reduced by 3.1% (Table 4), suggesting that matching sequencing reads derived from the reference ranges significantly increases imputation accuracy, even at substantially lower coverage depth., Comparison of imputation using complexity reduced sequencing technologies, Paired-end sequencing., Comparison of imputation using complexity reduced sequencing technologies, Paired-end sequencing., In addition to the 70 independent accessions characterized by GBS that were not used for PHG database construction, we utilized GBS reads generated for a set of 2,100 NAMgbs RILs from the spring wheat NAM panel (Jordan et al. 2018), and performed genotype imputation at 1.4 million variable sites. The common parent of these NAM RILs, cv. Berkut, was included into the Wheat PHG, and therefore this population does not necessarily represent an independent dataset for imputation as the GBS70 population did. However, for three families comprising the wheat NAM population, both parents were represented in the Wheat PHG, which allows us to investigate imputation accuracy for a set of RILs, which had either both or only a single parental haplotype being represented in the PHG database., The mean accuracy of imputation across the 2100 RILs was 89.2%, ranging from 78% to 92% across individual lines (Figure 2B). Average imputation accuracies by families ranges from 88.3% to 90.4%, and the three families with both parents represented in the PHG database were among the top four most accurately imputed families (Supplementary Table S6). Even though there is only a 0.9% reduction [90.1% both parents; 89.2% single parent in database; P-value (ANOVA) < 2 × 10−16] in mean imputation accuracy for lines with both parents in the database, vs. those with one parent, all lines having one or two parents represented in the database were imputed more accurately (3.2% and 2.3%, respectively) than the 18 independent lines from GBS70 with the same depth of coverage, whose accuracy was 86.9% (Table 4). These estimates of imputation accuracy for the semi-dependent (representation of parents in the PHG database) NAMgbs RILs were slightly lower (2.5%) than those observed for the imputed genotypes in the 0.01× DS75 exome capture data, and likely explained by the relatively small overlap (∼5%) between the sites in the GBS and exome capture datasets (Jordan et al. 2015). Overall, these results indicate that a PHG database created by a panel of independent wheat lines re-sequenced by exome capture assay provides accurate imputation (∼87%) on the inference populations created by complexity reduced sequencing using GBS, as long as the coverage is ∼1× GBS target size, and imputation is even more accurate for lines that share haplotypes represented in the PHG database., We also evaluated the Wheat PHG imputation for a set of 24 NAM RILs genotyped using the whole-genome skim-seq approach (NAMskim). The genomic libraries generated for this set of RILs from the spring wheat NAM population (Jordan et al. 2018; Blake et al. 2019) were sequenced on an Illumina sequencer (2 × 150 bp run) to provide ∼0.1× genome coverage. The accuracy of PHG-imputed genotypes in the NAMskim dataset (85.3%) was lower than that obtained for genotypes in either the DS75 or 1x NAMgbs datasets (Table 4). In fact, this estimate was 3.9% lower for the same set of RILs [P-value (t-test) < 2.7 × 10−13] imputed from the NAMgbs dataset. This lower accuracy likely is associated with a lower proportion of skim-seq reads, mostly represented by reads from the repetitive regions, uniquely mapped to the wheat genome compared to the proportion of uniquely mapped reads from the exome capture and GBS datasets, which are enriched for the low-copy genomic regions (Saintenac et al. 2013; Jordan et al. 2015). The accuracy of imputation varied across different SNP frequency classes. For SNPs with MAF > 0.1, the accuracy of imputation improved by 4% for all NAMgbs RILs, and by 7.5% for NAMskim genotypes (Table 5). The accuracy reached nearly 90% for NAMskim and 92.5% for NAMgbs datasets when the MAF were ≥0.2 (Table 5, Figure 2C)., Relationship between minor allele frequency and the accuracy of imputation for reduced complexity semi-dependent datasets, Summary of all groups where MAF > 0.1., The sites within each MAF frequency bin were determined by frequency in the PHG database., Data from NAMgbs for the same 24 lines sequenced for NAMskim., Relationship between minor allele frequency and the accuracy of imputation for reduced complexity semi-dependent datasets, Summary of all groups where MAF > 0.1., The sites within each MAF frequency bin were determined by frequency in the PHG database., Data from NAMgbs for the same 24 lines sequenced for NAMskim., The ability to accurately impute genotypes across the genome in low-coverage sequencing datasets provides a cost-effective means for advancing the genetic dissection of trait variation. We used the imputed PHG genotypes to assess the genetic contribution to HD variation in a NAM family previously used for studying the genetics of recombination rate variation in wheat (Jordan et al. 2018). The NAM1 family was chosen as both parents were included into the PHG database, and imputation accuracy was the highest among all NAM families at 90.4% (Supplementary Table S6). A SR was applied to identify variants associated with phenotypic variation. Before mapping, co-segregating redundant markers were removed, resulting in nearly 10,000 markers with no missing data. The SR method identified 11 SNPs together explaining 90% of the variance in HD, which was measured over 2 years at three locations (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S7). Among these SNPs are loci with modest effect sizes located on the long arms of chromosomes 5A and 5D, within 10 Mb from the Vrn-A1 and Vrn-D1 loci, which play a major role in the regulation of flowering in wheat (Distelfeld et al. 2009). In addition, significant SNPs on chromosomes 1B and 1D were mapped to the regions within 50 Mb of the Elf-3 gene, which is associated with the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in wheat (Alvarez et al. 2016; Zikhali et al. 2016)., Relationship between the true and predicted phenotypes. Significant markers were identified by stepwise regression on heading date, total number of crossovers per line (TCO), and total number of distal crossovers per line (dCO) phenotypes., Relationship between the true and predicted phenotypes. Significant markers were identified by stepwise regression on heading date, total number of crossovers per line (TCO), and total number of distal crossovers per line (dCO) phenotypes., We also used the imputed genotypes to revisit the genetic analysis of meiotic crossover rate variation in the wheat NAM population (Jordan et al. 2018; Blake et al. 2019). In the previous study, using a limited number of SNPs genotyped using the 90K iSelect array and GBS, we performed SR analysis and identified 15 and 12 SNPs associated with variation in the TCO and the number of dCO, respectively (Jordan et al. 2018). The identified SNPs explained 48.6% of the variation for TCO and 41% of the variation for dCO. Using the PHG imputed genotypes, we mapped 16 SNPs that together explained 91% of the variance for TCO per line and 12 SNPs explaining 80% of the variance for dCO (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S7). Compared to the previous study, SR analyses based on the PHG imputed SNPs detected additional loci with smaller effects on crossover rate (Jordan et al. 2018). As a result, the average effect size estimates for TCO and dCO were 2.5 COs and 1.5 COs, respectively. These estimates were lower than the previously reported average effect sizes of 3.36 COs for TCO and 2.3 COs for dCO (Jordan et al. 2018). Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in marker density after imputation using the Wheat PHG helped to identify new loci with a broader range of effect sizes that together explain a higher proportion of genetic variance compared to the previous study (Jordan et al. 2018)., We constructed a Wheat PHG database using wheat lines from the major US breeding programs and demonstrated that PHG combined with inexpensive low-coverage genome sequencing could be used to impute genotypes with high accuracy, sufficient to identify variants with smaller effects and support high-resolution mapping studies. Our analyses suggest that the Wheat PHG has the potential to effectively utilize community-generated whole-exome capture datasets, currently including thousands of diverse wheat accessions from different geographic regions (Molero et al. 2018; He et al. 2019; Pont et al. 2019; Scott et al. 2021), to create a global resource for imputing genotypes. The imputation accuracy provided by the PHG in populations genotyped using skim-seq, GBS, as well as low-coverage exome sequencing approaches varied, but overall were comparable, indicating that the marker density in the large populations of wheat lines previously genotyped using these methods could be substantially increased by imputation with this newly developed Wheat PHG tool. In addition to improved imputation accuracy, another attractive feature of the Wheat PHG for imputation is its ability to directly use sequence data in the fastq format, which significantly simplifies and reduces time required for data processing., The accuracy of PHG imputation compared favorably with the commonly used imputation tool Beagle v.5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013), which imputed genotypes with 3.3% and 3.6% lower accuracy at 0.01× and 0.1× genome coverage levels, respectively. The Wheat PHG showed a substantial improvement in accuracy (10–15%) compared to Beagle for the cultivar Jagger that carries introgression from a wild relative that was represented in only one accession in the PHG database, indicating that PHG is more effective at utilizing the rare haplotypes in the reference panel than Beagle. In previous studies, imputation of exome capture data with Beagle in populations genotyped using the 90K SNP array and GBS was 93–97% (Jordan et al. 2015) and 98% (Nyine et al. 2019), respectively. These estimates of accuracy are slightly higher than those obtained in our current study, but overall are comparable, and likely associated with filtering applied to reduce the proportion of missing data in the imputed datasets (Nyine et al. 2019), and with the inclusion of more common variants from the array-based genotyping methods., Compared to the imputation accuracy of sorghum (94.1%) and maize (92–95%) PHGs (Jensen et al. 2020; Valdes Franco et al. 2020), our estimates of accuracy were slightly lower and are likely caused by genotyping errors associated with the misalignment of short reads to the more complex, highly repetitive, allopolyploid wheat genome. The higher imputation accuracy in the low-coverage DS75 datasets from the whole exome capture compared to the accuracy of whole genome skim-seq datasets, which are mostly composed of reads from the repetitive regions of the wheat genome, supports this explanation., Our results show a reduction in the accuracy of imputation in the regions preferentially located outside of the reference ranges, for example in the regions around the PstI sites sequenced by GBS. We show that imputation accuracy within the reference ranges with lower depth of coverage, for example in the DS75 dataset providing at 0.01× coverage of the exome capture regions, is higher (92%) compared to PstI sites with higher sequence coverage, ∼1× in the GBS database (89%), even for accessions that are included into the PHG database. One possible approach to improve imputation accuracy for GBS datasets could be to create reference ranges around the GBS-associated PstI sites. However, this may also increase the proportion of ranges located within the repetitive portion of the wheat genome and increase the chance of read misalignment, reducing imputation accuracy., The imputation accuracy among different allele frequency classes improves with an increase in the allele frequency and is higher for a reference allele than for an alternative allele. Consistent with these expectations, the accuracy of imputation in the GBS dataset improved from 87.1% for SNPs with MAF < 0.1 to 91.3% for SNPs with MAF > 0.4, and in the skim-seq dataset from 80.2% for SNPs with MAF < 0.1 to 89.0% for SNPs with MAF >0.4. Previous studies showed that an increase in the reference population size also increases the probability of capturing rare alleles and substantially improves the imputation accuracy of rare variants (Shi et al. 2017; Das et al. 2018). Our results suggest that the Wheat PHG appears to be more effective at utilizing rare haplotypes included into the reference panel for genotype imputation than the commonly used low-coverage imputation method from Beagle. This was demonstrated by imputing genotypes on chromosome 2A, which carries an introgression from A. ventricosa in cultivar Jagger (Cruz et al. 2016). The inclusion of genotyping data from the cultivar Overley, which also carries this A. ventricosa introgression, into the PHG database was sufficient for accurate imputation in Jagger. In spite of including genotyping data from cultivar Overley into the reference panel, Beagle imputation of chromosome 2A genotypes in Jagger was lower compared to PHG. Further efforts aimed at broadening the diversity of accessions in the Wheat PHG, including wheat lines carrying known introgressions from wild relatives, will be needed to improve the utility PHG tool for genotype imputation in wheat germplasm., The application of imputed genotypes to the genetic analyses of trait variation in the wheat NAM population showed that an increase in marker density increases the number of loci associated with trait variation and detects alleles that have smaller effects on phenotypes (e.g. recombination rate) than those previously detected using lower density marker sets. The increase in the number of significant loci also resulted in a higher proportion of genetic variance (80–91%) in recombination rate and HD being explained, suggesting that the imputed genotypes are better at capturing the genetic architecture of these traits, and have the potential to identify more adaptive and beneficial genetic targets in breeding programs., The raw sequence data for previously published accessions can be accessed from the NCBI Short-Read Archive database (BioProject SUB2540330 and PRJNA381058).

We recently developed the significant structural variant method for BSA-Seq data analysis that exhibits higher detection power than standard BSA-Seq analysis methods.

Here, we modified the original script to effectively detect the genomic region–trait associations using only bulk genome sequences.

Our results demonstrate that the genomic region(s) associated with the trait of interest could be reliably identified via the significant structural variant method without using the parental genome sequences., Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was developed for the quick identification of genetic markers associated with a trait of interest (Michelmore et al. 1991; Giovannoni et al. 1991). For a particular trait, two groups of individuals with contrasting phenotypes are selected from a segregating population. Equal amounts of DNA are pooled from each individual within a group. The pooled DNA samples are then examined via restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. Fragments unique to either group are potential genetic markers that may link to genes that control phenotypic expression to the trait of interest. Candidate markers are further tested against the population to verify the marker–trait associations. With the recent dramatic reductions in cost, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to more and more BSA studies for the identification of qualitative or quantitative trait loci (QTL; Duveau et al. 2014; Clevenger et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018b; Arikit et al. 2019; Imerovski et al. 2019; Lahari et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2020). This new technology is referred to as BSA-Seq. In BSA-Seq, pooled DNA samples are not subjected to RFLP/RAPD analysis but are directly sequenced instead. Genome-wide structural variants between bulks, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (InDel), are identified based on the sequencing data. Genomic regions linked to the trait-controlling gene(s) are then identified based on the enrichment of the SNP/InDel alleles in those regions in each bulk. The time-consuming and labor-intensive marker development and genetic mapping steps are eliminated in the BSA-Seq method. Moreover, SNPs/InDels can be detected genome-wide via NGS, which allows for the reliable identification of trait-associated genomic regions across the entire genome., For each SNP/InDel in a BSA-Seq dataset, the base (or oligo in the case of an InDel) that is the same as the reference genome is termed the reference base (REF), while the base that differs from the reference genome is referred to as an alternative base (ALT). Because each bulk contains many individuals, the vast majority of SNP loci in a bulk contain both REF and ALT bases. For each SNP, the number of reads of REF/ALT alleles is termed allele depth (AD). Because of the phenotypic selection via bulking, for trait-associated SNPs, the ALT allele should be enriched in one bulk while the REF allele should be enriched in the other. However, for SNPs unassociated with the trait, both ALT and REF alleles would be randomly segregated in both bulks and enriched in neither. Hence, these four AD values (REF/ALT reads from each bulk) can be used to assess how likely an SNP/InDel is associated with the trait., QTL-seq is the most widely used software program for BSA-Seq data analysis (Takagi et al. 2013; Yamakawa et al. 2021). It calculates the REF or ALT allele frequencies of an SNP in both bulks with the four AD values and assesses the likelihood the SNP locus is associated with the trait based on the allele frequency difference (ΔAF) between bulks. Another software program calculates the G-statistic value of an SNP with the four AD values and uses the calculated value to judge how likely the SNP is associated with the trait (Magwene et al. 2011). We refer to the former as the allele frequency method and the latter as the G-statistic method. We have previously developed the significant structural variant method for BSA-Seq data analysis (Zhang and Panthee 2020). In this method, an SNP/InDel is assessed with Fisher’s exact test using the AD values of both bulks. An SNP/InDel with a low P-value of Fisher’s exact test tends to have a high absolute ΔAF and G-statistic values. An SNP/InDel is considered significant if the P-value of Fisher’s exact test is lower than a specific type I error rate, e.g., α = 0.01, and nonsignificant if otherwise; a significant SNP (sSNP)/InDel is more likely associated with the trait of interest than a nonsignificant SNP/InDel. Theoretically, sSNPs/InDels should be clustered within and around trait-controlling genes and should not present in genomic regions not associated with the trait of interest. Since SNPs/InDels normally are not evenly distributed across chromosomes, we use the ratio of the significant structural variants to the total structural variants to judge if a genomic region is associated with the trait of interest in our method. This ratio is a parameter at the genomic region level, whereas both the allele frequency and the G-statistic value are parameters at the SNP level, which is the key difference between the significant structural variant method and the standard allele frequency and G-statistic methods, and the root cause of our method’s higher statistical power in the detection of the genomic region–trait associations., We tested the significant structural variant method using the BSA-Seq data of a rice cold-tolerance study (Yang et al. 2013). One of the parents in this study was rice cultivar Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. Its high-quality assembled genome sequences were used as the reference sequences for SNP/InDel calling as well, which makes the genotype calling and SNP/InDel filtering very straightforward: any locus in any bulk that is different from the REF allele is a valid SNP/InDel (Zhang and Panthee 2020). Only high-quality assembled genome sequences can serve as the reference sequences in genotype calling, an essential step in BSA-Seq data analysis. For most species, however, such sequences are available for only a single or limited number of lines. If lines without assembled high-quality genome sequences are used as the parents in BSA-Seq studies, the parental genomes are often sequenced via NGS for the determination of the parental origin of SNP alleles and the identification of parental heterozygous SNPs (htSNPs). Modification of our original method to allow the analysis of BSA-Seq data in the absence of assembled or NGS-generated parental genome sequences would provide greater flexibility and significantly reduce sequencing costs. Hence, we modified our original script to allow for the identification of the false-positive SNPs/InDels (homozygous structural variants that are the same in both bulks but different from those in the reference genome) and part of the heterozygous loci in the parents without the aid of the parental genome sequences. Using the modified script and the scripts for the standard G-statistic and allele frequency methods (Magwene et al. 2011; Takagi et al. 2013), we analyzed two public BSA-Seq datasets using either the genome sequences of both the parents and the bulks, or the bulk genome sequences alone. The results revealed that we can only achieve reliable detection of genomic region–trait associations via our modified script when using only the bulk genome sequences., The rice sequencing data used in this study were generated by Lahari et al. (2019). In that study, parents LD24 and VialoneNano were used to develop an F2 population of 178 plants. Both the resistant and the susceptible bulk contained 23 plants each. The DNA samples of both the parents and the bulks were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System and MiSeq v3 chemistry. The accession numbers of these sequences are ERR2696318 (parent LD24), ERR2696319 (parent VialoneNano), ERR2696321 (the resistant bulk from the F2 population), and ERR2696322 (the susceptible bulk from the F2 population). The maize dataset used in this study was generated by Zheng et al. (2020). Unlike the rice dataset generated by Yang et al. (2013), high-quality assembled genome sequences are not available to the parents of both the rice (Lahari et al. 2019) and maize (Zheng et al. 2020) datasets used here. However, the parental genomes were sequenced via NGS in both datasets, which is ideal for us to test how parental genome sequences affect the identification of trait-associated genomic regions via the allele frequency, G-statistic, and significant structural variant methods. A graphical overview of the analysis workflow is presented in Figure 1., The overview of the analysis workflow. PyBSASeq_WP.py (for the parent and bulk genome sequences) and PyBSASeq.py (for only the bulk genome sequences) are Python scripts for BSA-Seq data analysis., The overview of the analysis workflow. PyBSASeq_WP.py (for the parent and bulk genome sequences) and PyBSASeq.py (for only the bulk genome sequences) are Python scripts for BSA-Seq data analysis., The rice BSA-Seq sequencing data were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive using the Linux program wget, and the rice reference sequence (Release 47) was downloaded from https://plants.ensembl.org/Oryza_sativa/Info/Index. Sequencing data preprocessing and SNP calling were performed using fastp, samtools, BWA-MEM, and GATK4 (Li et al. 2009; McKenna et al. 2010; Li 2011, 2013; Chen et al. 2018a) as described previously (Zhang and Panthee 2020). When analyzing the BSA-Seq data with the genome sequences of both the parents and the bulks, bulk/parent SNP calling was performed separately. The common SNPs of the two SNP datasets were used for the downstream analysis (Figure 1). The SNP calling-generated .vcf file, but not the raw sequences, is available to the public for the maize dataset. Thus, SNP calling was performed only on the rice sequencing data. For BSA-Seq data analysis in maize, the CHROM, POS, QUAL, REF, ALT, GT, AD, and GQ fields of the .vcf file were extracted to a .tsv file using the GATK4 utility VariantsToTable, and the parental SNP set and the bulk SNP set were created from this .tsv file using a Python script., The SNP dataset generated via SNP calling was processed with our Python script to identify sSNP–trait associations. A single script contains all three methods. The workflow of the scripts is as follows:, Read the .tsv/.csv input file(s) generated via SNP calling into a pandas DataFrame (size-mutable and potentially heterogeneous two-dimensional tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns; McKinney 2010; Reback et al. 2021)., Perform SNP filtering on the pandas DataFrame., Calculate the P-values of Fisher’s exact test (the significant structural variant method), the ΔAF (allele frequency difference between bulks) values (the allele frequency method), or the G-statistic values (the G-statistic method) using the four AD values (ADref1 and ADalt1 of bulk 1 and ADref2 and ADalt2 of bulk 2) of each SNP in the filtered pandas DataFrame. The P-values of Fisher’s exact tests, the ΔAF values, and the G-statistic values of all SNPs on each chromosome are smoothed by applying a Savitzky–Golay filter (Savitzky and Golay 1964). The smoothed P-values are used to identify the sSNPs, while smoothed ΔAF/G-statistic values will be used to calculate the corresponding values of sliding windows in step 5., Estimate the threshold of the sSNP/totalSNP ratio, the ΔAF, or the G-statistic via simulation. A Savitzky–Golay filter (Savitzky and Golay 1964) is applied to the simulated values of ΔAF and G-statistic at the chromosome level as well to smooth the threshold curves. The thresholds will be used to identify the significant peaks/valleys in the plots generated in the next step., Use the sliding window algorithm to plot the sSNP/totalSNP ratios, the ΔAF values, or the G-statistic values against their genomic positions., In our previous BSA-Seq study, a parent of the bulks was the O. japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare, and its genome sequences were used as the reference sequences for SNP/InDel calling (Zhang and Panthee 2020). In the current dataset, the parents were LD24 and VialoneNano; many false-positive SNPs/InDels and heterozygous loci in the parents would be included in the dataset if analyzing the BSA-Seq data using the original script. Hence, SNP filtering is carried out a little differently from previously described, and its details are below (see Supplementary Table S1 for example):, Unmapped SNPs or SNPs mapped to the mitochondrial or chloroplast genome;, SNPs with an “NA” value in any column of the DataFrame;, SNPs with zero REF read and a single ALT allele in both bulks/parents;, SNPs with three or more ALT alleles in any bulk/parent;, SNPs with two ALT alleles and its REF read is not zero in any bulk/parent;, SNPs in which the bulk/parent genotypes do not agree with the REF/ALT bases;, SNPs in which the bulk/parent genotypes are not consistent with the AD values;, SNPs with a genotype quality (GQ) score less than 20 in any bulk;, SNPs with the sum of its AD values (ADref + ADalt) greater than six times of the average sequencing coverage in any bulk; and, SNPs heterozygous in any parent when parental genome sequences are available., In addition, for SNPs with two ALT alleles and zero REF read in both bulks/parents, the REF allele is replaced with the first allele in the “ALT” field, its ALT allele is replaced with the second allele in the original “ALT” field. The REF read and a comma after it are removed from both the AD fields (one for each bulk/parent). This step is carried out before checking the genotype agreement between bulks and the REF/ALT fields. When parental genome sequences are involved, the common SNP set is identified before filtering out the SNPs with a low GQ score in the parental SNP dataset., The sliding windows algorithm was used to facilitate the visualization of the distribution of the sSNP/totalSNP ratios, the ΔAF values, and the G-statistic values across the chromosomes. For all three methods, the size of the sliding windows is 2 Mb and the incremental step is 10 kb in rice; the values of these variables are 5 Mb and 10 kb, respectively, in maize., The tightly linked SNP alleles from the same parent tend to segregate together and should have a similar extent of allele enrichment and thus similar AD values. In an SNP dataset, the genotypes (GT) of each bulk/parent are represented as “GTref/GTalt” when an SNP contains both the REF and ALT bases in the GT field and the AD values in each bulk/parent is represented as “ADref, ADalt”. The genotype and the AD value of the REF allele are always placed first in both fields. For an SNP locus in the .tsv input file, the allele with the same genotype as the reference genome is defined as the REF allele. However, it is highly unlikely that all of the SNP alleles in a parent are the same as those in the reference genome, except in instances where reference genome sequences used in SNP calling are from one of the parents, as in the case of the cold-tolerance study as mentioned above (Yang et al. 2013). It is necessary to place the genotypes and AD values of all SNP alleles from one parent (the reference parent, e.g., LD24) in the REF position, and those from the other parent (e.g., VialoneNano) to the ALT position in the GT and AD fields to make the bulk dataset consistent. Thus, for a particular SNP, if the REF base in the .tsv file is different from the genotype of LD24, its GT/AD values in both bulks would be swapped, e.g., “G/A” to “A/G” and “19,9” (the REF read is 19 while the ALT read is 9 in a bulk in the .tsv input file) to “9,19” (the REF read becomes 9 and the ALT read becomes 19 after AD swapping). AD/GT swapping is performed following SNP filtering and only when the parental genome sequences are used to aid BSA-Seq data analysis. AD swapping ensures that adjacent SNPs have similar ΔAF values. Examples of AD/GT swapping are provided in Supplementary Table S1., Threshold estimation of ΔAF/G-statistic is performed for all SNPs in the dataset by simulation. For each SNP in a bulk, its sequencing depth (ADref + ADalt) and the ALT allele frequency in the population are used to simulate its ADref (smADref) and ADalt (smADalt) under the null hypothesis. The simulated smADref1/smADalt1 of bulk 1 and smADREF2/smADALT2 of bulk 2 are used to calculate the ΔAF or the G-statistic. This process is repeated 10,000 times, the 99% confidence interval of the 10,000 ΔAF values is used as a significant threshold for the allele frequency method, and the 99.5th percentile of the 10,000 G-statistic values is used as a significant threshold for the G-statistic method. As in the real dataset, the threshold of a sliding window is the average value of all SNPs in it., For each SNP in the dataset, Fisher’s exact test was performed using its four AD values: ADref1/ADalt1 of bulk 1 and ADref2/ADalt2 of bulk 2. An SNP with its P-value less than α = 0.01 is defined as a sSNPs. For a trait-associated SNP (located in a trait-controlling gene or tightly linked to the gene), the more the gene contributes to the phenotype, the more its REF/ALT allele would be enriched in either bulk and the more likely it would be identified as an sSNP. SNPs are not distributed evenly along a chromosome, thus it is very likely that different sliding windows contain different numbers of SNPs. Therefore, the sSNP/totalSNP ratio is used to measure sSNP enrichment in a sliding window., Calculating a threshold requires simulating ADref/ADalt values and calculating the P-value of Fisher’s exact test for each SNP in a sliding window. This process needs to be repeated 10,000 times for a sliding window. Doing so for all sliding windows of the SNP dataset would take a very long time. To overcome this obstacle, we first calculate a genome-wide threshold and use it to identify potential significant peaks, then sliding window thresholds of these peaks are calculated via simulation to verify if the sSNP/totalSNP ratios of these peak sliding windows are really significant., The number of SNPs that are the same as the average number of SNPs per sliding window are randomly selected from the entire SNP dataset. For each SNP in this sample, smADref1/smADalt1 of bulk 1 and smADref2/smADalt2 of bulk 2 are obtained via simulation as above. These simulated AD values are used to perform Fisher’s exact test; an SNP with its P-value less than α = 0.10 is considered an sSNP. This process (starting from sampling SNPs) is repeated 10,000 times, and the 99.5th percentile of these 10,000 simulated sSNP/totalSNP ratios is used as the significance threshold for the detection of potential significant peaks. A higher α value (10× higher than that used in the real SNP dataset) is used here, resulting in the identification of more sSNPs from the simulated SNP sub-dataset, hence a higher threshold and fewer false positives., Estimating a sliding window threshold is very similar to estimating the genome-wide threshold; the only difference is that we do not need to sample SNPs from the genome. Instead, smADref and smADalt of each SNP in each bulk in the sliding window are obtained via simulation, and Fisher’s exact test, identification of sSNPs, and sSNP/totalSNP calculation are carried out in the same way as above. This process is repeated 10,000 times, and again the 99.5th of these 10,000 simulated sSNP/totalSNP ratios is used as the threshold for this sliding window., We first test how parental genome sequences affected QTL detection in rice. The original sequence reads of the rice data were 3.9G, 3.8G, 3.4G, and 3.5G; they became 3.8G, 3.6G, 3.3G, and 3.4G after quality control, respectively, in ERR2696318 (parent LD24), ERR2696319 (parent VialoneNano), ERR2696321 (the resistant bulk), and ERR2696322 (the susceptible bulk), which correspond to 8.8×, 8.5×, 7.6×, and 7.9× coverage, respectively (Lahari et al. 2019). The preprocessed sequences were used for SNP calling to generate an SNP dataset, which was analyzed using the modified significant structural variant method, the G-statistic method, and the allele frequency method with or without the aid of the parental genome sequences., The SNP calling-generated parent/bulk SNP dataset was processed with the Python script PyBSASeq_WP.py. SNP filtering was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. The parental SNP dataset was processed first. All algorithms assume all SNP loci are homozygous in the parental lines, and threshold estimation is based on this assumption. Therefore, the SNPs heterozygous in any parent were eliminated. Although most rice breeding lines should be homozygous in most loci, more than 7% htSNP loci (2,011,062 homozygous and 153,000 heterozygous) were identified in the parental SNP dataset. However, the GATK’s variant calling tools are designed to be very lenient in order to achieve a high degree of sensitivity (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-), and it is possible that some sequencing artifacts were identified as heterozygous alleles. The bulk SNP dataset was processed second. The SNPs with the same chromosome ID, the same genomic coordinate, and the same allele composition in both datasets were considered common SNPs. Common SNPs in the bulk dataset were used to detect SNP–trait associations for all three methods., Each SNP in the dataset was tested via Fisher’s exact test using its four AD values, and SNPs with P-values less than α = 0.01 were defined as sSNPs. The chromosomal distributions of the sSNPs and the total SNPs are summarized in Table 1. Using the sliding window algorithm, the genomic distribution of the sSNPs, the total SNPs, and the sSNP/totalSNP ratios of sliding windows were plotted against their genomic position (Figure 2, A and B). A genome-wide threshold was estimated as 0.0538 via simulation, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Two peaks above the threshold were identified: a minor one on chromosome 9 and a major one on chromosome 11. The position of the peak on chromosome 9 was at 1.11 Mb, the sliding window contained 230 sSNPs and 3738 total SNPs, corresponding to an sSNP/totalSNP ratio of 0.0615; the position of the peak on chromosome 11 was at 26.44 Mb, the sliding window contained 675 sSNPs and 1139 total SNPs, corresponding to an sSNP/totalSNP ratio of 0.5926. The sliding window-specific threshold was estimated for each peak via simulation, and the values were 0.0551 and 0.0623, respectively, indicating both peaks were significant. Both values are higher than the genome-wide threshold, probably due to the lower amount of total SNPs in these sliding windows. The average SNPs per sliding window was 5893., BSA-Seq data analysis using both the parental and bulk genome sequences or the bulk genome sequences alone in rice. The red lines/curves are the thresholds using both the parental and bulk genome sequences, while the yellow lines/curves are the thresholds using only the bulk genome sequences. The black curves represent the number of sSNPs (A), sSNP/totalSNP ratios (B), G-statistic values (C), or ΔAF values (D) using the genome sequence of both the parents and bulks.

The same is true for the yellow lines/curves and the red lines/curves., Chromosomal distribution of SNPs—using the genome sequences of both the parents and the bulks, Chromosomal distribution of SNPs—using the genome sequences of both the parents and the bulks, The G-statistic value of each SNP in the dataset was calculated, and its threshold was estimated via simulation as described in the Materials and Methods section. Using the sliding window algorithm, the G-statistic value of each sliding window, the average G-statistic values of all SNPs in that sliding window, was plotted against its genomic position (Figure 2C), and the curve pattern was very similar to that in Figure 2B. A significant peak was identified on chromosome 11; its position was at 26.43 Mb, its G-statistic value was 12.8068, well above the threshold 9.0574., The ΔAF value of each SNP in the dataset was calculated, and the ΔAF threshold of the SNP was estimated via simulation as described in the Materials and Methods section. Using the sliding window algorithm, the ΔAF value of each sliding window, the average ΔAF values of all SNPs in that sliding window, was plotted against its genomic position (Figure 2D). A significant peak on chromosome 11 was identified, the peak position was located at 26.37 Mb, its ΔAF value was 0.7178, and the 99% confidence interval was to −0.6508 to 0.6508. The ΔAF curves of all chromosomes are very similar to those created by Lahari et al. (2019)., The SNP calling-generated bulk SNP dataset was processed with the Python script PyBSASeq.py. The methods and parameters were the same as above; the only difference was that the parental SNP dataset was not used here. Using a different color scheme, the genomic distribution of the sSNPs, the total SNPs, the sSNP/totalSNP ratios, the G-statistic values, and the ΔAF values are plotted in Figure 2 for easy comparison., The chromosomal distribution of the sSNPs and total SNPs are summarized in Table 2. The total number of SNPs was 1,346,185 here, much higher than the above, which was 1,099,516. The number of the sSNPs and total SNPs in every sliding window are always higher when the parental genome sequences were not used (Figure 2A). The patterns of the cyan curves (without the aid of the parental genome sequences) were very similar to those of the black curves (with the aid of the parental genome sequences). The sSNP/totalSNP ratios in the low sSNP/totalSNP ratio regions did not change much, and the cyan curves largely overlap with the black curves in these genomic intervals. In contrast, sSNP/totalSNP ratios of the sliding windows were decreased significantly in the high sSNP/totalSNP ratio regions, leading to missing the minor locus on chromosome 9. Only the peak on chromosome 11 was significant; it was located at 26.96 Mb, a 0.52 Mb shift (Figure 2B). The peak sliding window contained 1122 sSNPs and 2945 total SNPs, corresponding to a 0.3810 sSNP/totalSNP ratio, well above the genome-wide threshold (0.0535) and the sliding window-specific threshold (0.0601). The average SNPs per sliding window was 7215., Chromosomal distribution of SNPs—using only the bulk genome sequences, Chromosomal distribution of SNPs—using only the bulk genome sequences, The patterns of the G-statistic value plot were very similar with or without the aid of the parental genome sequences. Similar to those in the significant structural variant method, the G-statistic values were significantly decreased in high-value regions; only a single sliding window was above the threshold (8.8975); its position was at 26.96 Mb, and its G-statistic value was 8.9119 (Figure 2C)., Without the aid of the parental genome sequences, the pattern of the ΔAF curve of chromosome 11, especially the genomic region associated with the trait, was drastically different. Differences in the curve patterns were observed in other chromosomes as well, but they were relatively minor (Figure 2D). No peaks/valleys are significant; all ΔAF values were within the 99% confidence interval, although AD swapping was performed on only 67,396 SNPs, 6.1% of total SNPs., Sequencing coverage affects QTL detection. Higher coverage is required to detect minor QTLs than major QTLs (Zhang and Panthee 2020). Rice has the smallest genome size among the major cereal crops; maize has a genome size approximately six times that of rice (Haberer et al. 2005). The cost would be much higher in maize than in rice to obtain the same sequencing coverage. Eliminating the need for the parental genome sequences would significantly reduce the sequencing cost for BSA-Seq studies in maize. Here, we analyzed a maize SNP dataset generated by Zheng et al. (2020) to test how well our script works on a crop with a much larger genome. Using the dataset, Zheng et al. identified a major QTL controlling fertility restoration of the maize cms-c (C-type cytoplasmic male sterility) gene via the allele frequency method. We analyzed the dataset using the allele frequency, G-statistic, and significant structural variant methods. With the aid of the parental genome sequences, results similar to those in Zheng et al. were obtained using the allele frequency methods; a significant peak on chromosome 8 was identified. However, many more QTLs were identified using the significant structural variant method: in addition to the major locus on chromosome 8, significant peaks on all chromosomes were identified (Figure 3B), with major QTLs located on chromosomes 2, 8, and 9. Without the aid of the parental genome sequences, the sSNP/totalSNP ratios were decreased significantly in the high-value regions, but significant peaks were still identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Most peaks are in very similar positions with or without the aid of the parental genome sequences for the significant structure variant methods, but a few peaks shifted significantly. The major peak on chromosome 8 shifted from 129.90 to 138.22 Mb. Most peaks are also in very similar position for the G-statistic method, but G-statistic values were reduced dramatically without the aid of the parental genome sequences, and no significant peaks were above the thresholds and no QTLs were identified via this method (Figure 3, B and C). However, the ΔAF curves are drastically different across the genome when only the bulk sequences were used and no significant peaks/valleys were detected (Figure 3D). Linked SNPs should have the same P-values, ΔAF values, and G-statistic values if recombination does not occur between them. Many peaks in a short genomic region on chromosomes 2 and 8 in Figure 3, B–D are observed, which is either curved by high frequency of recombination hot spots in those regions or is just noise caused by other genetic factors or introduced by experiment design. Large duplication could be one of such genetic factors. If a genomic region contains a large duplication and there are many",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SNPs between the duplicated copies, these SNPs would affect the P-values, ΔAF, and G-statistic values of sliding windows in this genomic region., BSA-Seq data analysis using both the parental and bulk genome sequences or the bulk genome sequences alone in maize.

(D) Genomic distributions of ΔAF values., We tested how parental genome sequences affected the detection of SNP–trait associations via BSA-Seq using a dataset of the rice root-knot nematode resistance and a dataset of the maize cms-c fertility restoration. We analyzed these datasets with the significant structural variant, the G-statistic, and the allele frequency methods. Using the genome sequences of both the parents and bulks, two QTLs in rice and more than 10 QTLs in maize were detected via the significant structural variant method. However, only a single major locus was detected in both maize and rice via the G-statistic method or the allele frequency method. The results, including QTL detection, the curve patterns, and peak/valley positions, obtained via the allele frequency method are similar to those in the original studies (Lahari et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2020). The positions of the peaks/valleys detected via different methods were not the same, but they were very close to each other (black curves in Figures 2, B–D, and 3, B–D). Using only the bulk genome sequences, most peaks of the sSNP/totalSNP ratios and the G-statistic values are in similar positions compared to those with the aid of parental genome sequences, but their values were decreased significantly in many genomic regions, leading to missing some minor QTLs via the structural variant method and all minor QTLs and most of major QTLs via the G-statistic method; the only unmissed QTL via the G-statistic method has a single sliding window above the threshold (cyan curves in Figures 2, B and C, and 3, B and C). On the other hand, both peak positions and the ΔAF values can be altered dramatically, and no QTL can be detected via the allele frequency method when the parental genome sequences were not used (cyan curves in Figures 2D and 3D)., The significant structural variant method assesses if an SNP is likely associated with the trait via Fisher’s exact test. The greater the ALT proportion differences between the bulks, the less the P-value of the Fisher’s exact test, and the more likely the SNP is associated with the trait. Fisher’s exact test takes a numpy array or a Python list as its input, the same P-value will be obtained with either [(ADref1, ADalt1), (ADref2, ADalt2)] or [(ADalt1, ADref1), (ADalt2, ADref2)] as its input. The G-statistic method assesses if an SNP is likely associated with the trait via the G-test; the greater the G-statistic value of an SNP, the more likely it contributes to the trait phenotype (Magwene et al. 2011). The G-statistic values are the same with either input [(ADref1, ADalt1), (ADref2, ADalt2)] or [(ADalt1, ADref1), (ADalt2, ADref2)]. Changing the AD value (REF/ALT reads) order in the array/list does not affect the P-value of Fisher’s exact test or the G-statistic value of G-test, which is why the parental genome sequences-guided AD swapping does not alter the curve patterns of both methods. Therefore, theoretically, parental genome sequences are not required to identify genomic region–trait associations in either the significant structural variant method or the G-statistic method., We used the bulk SNPs that also exist in the parents for BSA-Seq data analysis when using the genome sequences of both the parents and bulks, and the htSNPs in the parents were filtered out as well. Without the aid of the parental genome sequences, we can only filter out htSNPs containing three or four alleles in an SNP locus (e.g., the genotype of a parent is A/T and the genotype of the other parent is T/G, T/C, A/G, A/C, G/C, GG, or CC at this SNP locus), but not the htSNPs containing only two alleles in an SNP locus (e.g., the genotype of a parent is G/C and the genotype of the other parent is CC, GG, or G/C at this SNP locus). In addition, there are always bulk-specific SNPs (bsSNPs); if a portion of the genome is sequenced in the bulks but not in the parents, the SNPs in this genomic region will be bsSNPs; sequencing artifacts can create bsSNPs as well. Thus, the bulk SNP dataset could contain a significant number of extra SNPs when only the bulk genome sequences were used. In the rice data set, there were 1,345,185 SNPs in the bulk dataset when not using the parental genome sequences,137,224 of them were htSNPs (heterozygous in the parental lines) while 109,445 SNPs of them were unique to the bulks, and the rest 1,99,516 SNPs were the same as in the dataset with the aid of the parental genome sequences. In the maize dataset, the bulk SNP dataset size was 16,573,961 when only the bulk genome sequences were used,6,549,258 of them were htSNPs while 3,195,935 of them were bsSNPs, and the rest 6,828,768 were the same as in the dataset with the aid of the parental genome sequences., To determine how htSNPs and bsSNPs affected the detection of genomic region–trait associations via the significant structural variant method, we extracted the htSNPs/bsSNPs from the bulk SNP dataset and created subdatasets containing only htSNPs or bsSNPs. We first analyzed the rice dataset. We plotted the numbers of htSNPs, bsSNPs, genome heterozygosity, and ratios of sSNPs in htSNPs or bsSNPs to the total SNPs using the sliding window algorithm (Figure 4). Although low at the genome level, heterozygosity can be ∼60% in some SNP sparse regions (Figure 4B). The sSNPs of the htSNPs/bsSNPs contribute little to the overall sSNP/totalSNP ratios in the vast majority of genomic regions, but the sSNPs of the htSNPs contributes ∼0.04 and the sSNPs of the bsSNPs contributes ∼0.02 to the overall sSNP/totalSNP ratios around the major QTL (Figure 4C). The curve patterns of this region in Figures 2B and 4C are similar as well. It is likely that the contribution of htSNPs/bsSNPs to the overall sSNP/totalSNP ratio is real in this genomic region. It is possible that we used too stringent conditions in filtering out htSNPs in the parents so that some identified htSNPs are actually homozygous. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some bsSNPs were generated by sequencing artifacts, it is possible that some genomic regions were really not sequenced in the parents but were sequenced in the bulks considering the low sequencing coverage (less than 9×). We then plotted the numbers of htSNPs, bsSNPs, genome heterozygosity, and the ratios of sSNPs in htSNPs/bsSNPs to total SNPs of the maize dataset using the sliding window algorithm (Figure 5). The number of bsSNPs is much less than that of the htSNPs (Figure 5A). The genome heterozygosity is ∼39.5% (Figure 5B), indicating an average ∼20% or higher heterozygosity in the parental lines (common htSNPs shared between the parents were counted only once in obtaining the 39.5% heterozygosity rate), which is much higher than that in the rice dataset (∼3.5%). Heterozygosity is very high (>60%) in some genomic regions, and the positions of such regions are correlated very well to the positions of the deep valleys on chromosomes 2 and 8 (Figures 3B and 5B). The maximum contribution of the sSNPs in htSNPs/bsSNPs to the overall sSNP/totalSNP is less than 0.0075. Thus, both htSNPs and bsSNPs mainly increase the total SNPs, not the number of sSNPs, which significantly decreases the sSNP/totalSNP ratios in the QTL regions. Low genome heterozygosity as in the rice dataset has very minor effects on the peak position shift, but too many htSNPs as in the maize dataset can significantly shift some peaks of sSNP/totalSNP ratios and G-statistic values. It is difficult to remove htSNPs with two alleles from the dataset in a software approach without the aid of parental genome sequences, but their negative effects on the sSNP/totalSNP ratios and peak shift can be minimized if F2 populations are constructed with seeds from a single F1 plant or the parents are selfed more generations., The effects of htSNPs and sequencing bsSNPs on BSA-Seq data analysis when only the bulk genome sequences were used in rice.

(C) Genomic distributions of the ratios of sSNPs from htSNPs (magenta) or bsSNPs (gray) to the totalSNPs using the dataset with only the bulk genome sequences., All three methods can be used to identify both qualitative and QTL; the allele frequency is particularly informative to determine if an SNP is associated with a qualitative or quantitative trait locus. For an incomplete dominant locus, we expect 100% of ALT allele frequency in one bulk while 0% of ALT allele frequency in the other bulk. For a dominant locus, one bulk should contain 66.7% heterozygous and 33.3% dominant homozygous individuals, corresponding to 66.7% ALT allele frequency (treat the dominant allele as the ALT allele), and the other bulk should contain 100% recessive homozygous individuals, corresponding to 0% ALT allele frequency. For a QTL, allele enrichment is dependent on how much it contributes to the trait. The major QTL would have high allele enrichment, while the minor QTL would have low allele enrichment. The ALT allele frequency of an SNP in a QTL should be lower than 100% but could be higher than that of a dominant locus. The peak on chromosome 11 in rice (Figure 2B) should represent an incomplete dominant locus: a cluster of SNPs around the peak have allele frequency of 100% in one bulk and 0% in the other bulk. The highest peak on chromosome 8 in maize (Figure 3B) is very likely a dominant locus: a cluster of SNPs around this peak have allele frequency of ∼67% in one bulk and 0% in the other bulk. The highest frequency of such SNPs is around 140 Mb on chromosome 8, very close to the peak identified with only the bulk genome sequences. As expected, the SNP alleles with 0% allele frequency in the cluster are from the same bulk (after AD/GT swapping and removing htSNPs and bsSNPs) in both rice or maize. Some SNPs with ALT allele frequency not equal to 0% intermingled in the clusters was observed in these regions; it is very likely they are caused by sequencing artifacts or SNPs between large duplications in the genome. The other significant peaks should represent QTLs. Our results suggest that rice nematode resistance is controlled by a single incomplete dominant gene with a minor modifier while maize cms-c fertility restoration is controlled by a dominant gene with many modifiers. These modifiers are most likely QTLs., Both the allele frequency and the G-statistic methods use an SNP level parameter to identify significant sliding windows to detect the genomic region–trait associations. The significant structural variant method, however, uses the sSNP/totalSNP ratio, a parameter at the sliding window level, to measure the sSNP enrichment in a sliding window for the identification of the trait-associated genomic regions. An SNP normally has less than 100 reads because of the cost concern, while a sliding window normally contains thousands of SNPs. Thus, the significant structural variant method has much higher statistical power, which is consistent with our observations. Moreover, we used α = 0.01 for the identification of sSNPs in the real SNP dataset, whereas we used α = 0.1 for the same purpose in the simulated SNP dataset when estimating thresholds, leading to the identification of more sSNPs in the simulated SNP dataset and thus higher sSNP/totalSNP thresholds. For the rice dataset, the genome-wide threshold is 0.0538 with the aid of the parental genome sequences and 0.0535 without the aid of the parental genome sequences with α = 0.1 for threshold estimation (Figure 2B). When using α = 0.05 for threshold estimation, the thresholds are much lower, 0.0275 with the aid of the parental genome sequences and 0.0273 without the aid of the parental genome sequence; in addition to the major locus on chromosome 11 and the minor locus on chromosome 9, a significant peak on chromosome 6 was identified with or without the aid of the parental genome sequences. Similarly, the sSNP/totalSNP thresholds were decreased significantly in maize using α = 0.05 for threshold estimation and thus more minor QTLs were detected. The sSNP/totalSNP ratio of a sliding window within a genomic region not associated with the trait should be zero. The sSNP/totalSNP ratios of the sliding windows on the entire chromosomes 2,7,8, and 12 and the vast majority of the genomic regions of the other chromosomes are very close to zero in Figure 2B, and the ratios of the majority regions of chromosomes 1,3, and 5 in Figure 3B are very close to zero as well, suggesting the background noise of the significant structural method is very low and it is reasonable to use α = 0.05 for threshold estimation. Therefore, the significant structural variant method can be used to reliably detect major QTLs and some minor QTLs when the parental genome sequences are not available., The scripts and their usage can be found on https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq.

We evaluate the performance of the gap-com statistic in graphical model selection and compare its performance to some existing methods using simulated and real biological data examples., Network modeling has been widely applied to examine the co-expression relationships between genes, which are estimated from the expression values using some co-expression measure (e.g. pairwise correlation between two genes). These measures indicate which genes are active simultaneously, implying that they are operating in the same biological processes (van Dam et al. 2018). In particular, gene clusters (groups of genes with a distinct pattern of pairwise co-expression relationships among each other) and hub genes (genes which are co-expressed with numerous other genes) have a key role in the functionality of the gene co-expression network itself (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004; Serin et al. 2016). Therefore, gene co-expression networks are usually complex and here they are assumed to be different from random networks, whose trivial community structure is determined by chance alone. For a review about methods which can be used for co-expression network modeling, see, e.g. Wang and Huang (2014). A special case of gene co-expression networks is obtained with the weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) (Zhang and Horvath 2005; Horvath 2011) which is a widely used technique. For some other highly cited articles (see, e.g. Stuart et al. 2003; Horvath and Dong 2008; Langfelder and Horvath 2008; Voineagu et al. 2011; Bailey et al. 2016)., As gene expression data sets are often high-dimensional, it is more useful to concentrate on examining only a much smaller subset of genes: we assume that most of the observed co-expressions between genes do not display relevant gene associations. Therefore, one can examine a smaller subset of significant gene associations directly by inducing sparsity into the estimated network topology resulting in a sparse network model. Several methods which can be applied in gene co-expression analysis, have been proposed for sparse network modeling. These methods are based on penalized estimation (Banerjee et al. 2008; Friedman et al. 2008), constrained optimization (Cai et al. 2011; Liu and Luo 2015; Liu and Wang 2017), and thresholding together with multiple testing correction (Ha and Sun 2014; van Wieringen and Peeters 2016) to mention a few examples (see also Rothman et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2016; Drton and Maathuis 2017; Kuismin and Sillanpää 2017). The common characteristic of these methods is that the sparsity of the output graph is usually controlled by a user-defined parameter (a tuning or a penalty parameter, a threshold parameter, a significance threshold, etc.) such that the model selection culminates in hyperparameter tuning. Here, we make the assumption that tuning of this single parameter is enough to recover all the pairwise co-expression relationships between genes in sufficient detail., Despite the multitude of different model selection criteria such as the classic model selection criteria (CV, AIC, and BIC) (see, e.g. Bien and Tibshirani 2011; Liu et al. 2010) and model selection criteria developed especially for sparse networks such as the extended Bayesian information criterion (eBIC), GAIC and GBIC (Foygel and Drton 2010; Abbruzzo et al. 2019), and stability approach to regularization selection (StARS) (Liu et al. 2010) (see also Yuan and Lin 2007; Anandkumar et al. 2012; Vujačić et al. 2015; Kuismin and Sillanpää 2021), there are still only a few model selection methods available that evaluate different models based on the characteristics which are specific to complex networks (Mestres et al. 2018)., We are interested in finding nontrivial co-expression relationships, such as network communities (gene clusters) in our sparse network model when the network is constructed from gene expression values. In this study, we introduce the gap-com statistic (gap community statistic) that is a network model selection criterion used to estimate the quality of a collection of models for gene expression data. The gap-com statistic is used to choose biologically more relevant complex network models with distinguishable community structure. Our criterion shares characteristics with the gap statistic (Tibshirani et al. 2001) but there are a few features that distinguish the gap-com statistic from the original gap statistic: First, in the context of the network parameter estimation, one can control the number of clusters only indirectly, meaning that the number of clusters behaves like a random variable. Second, we introduce a new strategy that does not include data resampling but compares different models with sparse random network models constructed from rearranged data points. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of comparison has not been used with the gap statistic before., Our formulation provides a basis for a general model selection technique for hyperparameter tuning, when the sparsity of the network model is controlled with one or more hyperparameters. We use simulated and empirical data sets to illustrate that the gap-com statistic is well suited for sparse network model selection, while the ground truth network has a community structure making it convenient for realistic gene co-expression analysis., The paper is structured as follows. In Section Materials and methods, we describe the basic undirected network models applied in the rest of the paper and develop the gap-com statistic. Section Simulations provides simulation to evaluate the performance of the gap-com statistic in model selection. Section Staphylococcus aureus DREAM5 data illustrates the gap-com statistic with a real co-expression network analysis.

We use n to denote the number of these observations, commonly referred to as the number of samples. The co-expression network model can then be constructed from these gene-by-gene co-expression measures. In particular, two of the most widely used undirected graphical models applied in the co-expression analysis are Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) and models constructed using the Pearson correlation coefficients (hereafter called the correlation network) (Drton and Perlman 2007; Stuart et al. 2003). In GGMs, pair (i, j) is contained in the set E if and only if the partial correlation coefficient between genes i and j is measured as non-zero, that is, the correlation between genes i and j is non-zero given all other genes V∖{i,j} (Drton and Perlman 2007). In correlation network, pair (i, j) is contained in the set E if and only if the Pearson correlation coefficient between i and j is non-zero., The difference between these models is that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear co-expression relationships between genes and the partial correlation is capable of separating direct from undirect links between genes. Although the correlation might be sensitive to non-normality of the expression values, the measure itself does not assume normally distributed data like the partial correlation (GGMs) does. Both of these measures are unable to detect possible nonlinear co-expression relationships between genes. Other measures (coefficients) one can consider which are capable of modeling both linear and nonlinear dependencies between genes are, e.g. Spearman’s rank correlation, Kendall rank correlation coefficient, the distance correlation (Székely et al. 2007), mutual information (see, Husain et al. 2020, and the references therein), and the maximal information coefficient (Reshef et al. 2011). See also Kontio et al. (2020)., Tibshirani et al. (2001) presented the original gap statistic in unsupervised clustering context to determine the number of clusters in a data set. Practical experience has shown that when one plots the within-cluster variation against the number of clusters, the variation first decreases rapidly, but after passing some value of the number of clusters, there is a visible deceleration of the decrease. Like Tibshirani et al. (2001) stated, statistical “folklore” informs that the location of such an “elbow” indicates the appropriate number of clusters. They proposed a rigorous method to choose the number of clusters by comparing the within-cluster variation with its expectation under the so-called reference distribution (data points with no distinct clustering structure). The estimate of k will be the value which maximizes the “gap” between observed within-cluster variation and its expectation under the reference distribution., In unsupervised learning models, like in network construction, although the number of clusters (communities in a sparse network) cannot be controlled, the sparsity of the estimated network can be controlled by adjusting the value of a tuning parameter. By changing the sparsity level, one can indirectly influence how communities are determined by setting low co-expression measures (e.g. correlation coefficients which are close to zero) exactly to zero. In Kuismin et al. (2017), we noticed that if there is a distinct clustering structure in the genetic data, the community detection algorithm seems to favor a specific number of communities with certain values of the tuning parameter, although the sparsity of the corresponding network models change. We assume that the (community) structure of a data-driven gene co-expression network, which is close to the “true” clustering of the co-expression relationships between the genes, is more invariant to the changes of the parameters of the estimator M in (2) than a network where the co-expression relationship clustering structure is governed by noisy measurements. Therefore, instead of examining how the cluster dispersion measure deviates from the expectation under the reference distribution, we examine how the number of communities deviates from the expected number of communities under the null hypothesis that the pairwise co-expression relationships between genes are determined by chance. Thus, the constructed gene co-expression network does not show any clustering structure. Next, we propose how to approximate the number of communities under the null hypothesis by permuting the gene labels in the observed data., We propose 2 different strategies to estimate the unknown quantity E{k(λ)}⁠. The first approach is based on permutations of the gene labels of the observed expression levels. We evaluate E{k(λ)} by repeating the permutation process several times and then compute the average of k(λ) over each random permutation. The workflow of this strategy is as follows:, For a single permutation of the observed data, randomly shuffle the gene expression values of each gene i, i=1,…p⁠. Thus, the estimated pairwise (partial) correlation coefficients between genes i and j are determined randomly and we get the distribution of the co-expression relationships under the null hypothesis., Construct the gene network from the permuted observed data with the regularization parameter value λ and identify the number of communities k^n(λ) in the network., Repeat the first and the second step to evaluate the expected number of communities E{k(λ)} under the null hypothesis (i.e. communities are detected only by chance) as the mean value of the copies of k^n(λ)⁠., Repeat steps 1–3 for each value of λ., Define E^n{k(λ)} which denotes the estimator of the expected number of communities under the null hypothesis computed with the permutation process described above. We have illustrated the gap statistic computed using the permutation process in Fig. 1 where we use the Walktrap algorithm (Pons and Latapy 2006) to estimate the number of communities., Permutation strategy. In this toy example, the ground truth graph is a star-graph with 100 distinct hubs (stars) (p = 500, n = 1,000). We use hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute sparse network estimates. a) Curves of estimated k(λ) (blue solid line) and estimator E^n{k(λ)} (red dashed line) are both determined with the Walktrap community detection algorithm as a function of the hard-threshold parameter λ. b) Gap-com curve as a function of estimated k. We set the number of permutations to 50 to estimate the unknown quantity E{k(λ)}⁠. The vertical dashed line in the left-hand figure corresponds to the parameter value that maximizes Gap(λ)⁠. The vertical dashed line in the right-hand figure corresponds to the true number of hubs., Permutation strategy. In this toy example, the ground truth graph is a star-graph with 100 distinct hubs (stars) (p = 500, n = 1,000). We use hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute sparse network estimates. a) Curves of estimated k(λ) (blue solid line) and estimator E^n{k(λ)} (red dashed line) are both determined with the Walktrap community detection algorithm as a function of the hard-threshold parameter λ. b) Gap-com curve as a function of estimated k. We set the number of permutations to 50 to estimate the unknown quantity E{k(λ)}⁠. The vertical dashed line in the left-hand figure corresponds to the parameter value that maximizes Gap(λ)⁠. The vertical dashed line in the right-hand figure corresponds to the true number of hubs., The second strategy is to apply the properties of the Erdős-Rényi random graph model G(p,s) (hereafter E-R graph). In the E-R model, a graph is constructed by connecting labeled genes randomly: Each gene-by-gene co-expression relationship is included in the gene co-expression network model with probability s, independently from other gene-by-gene co-expression relationships. The parameter s in this model can be considered as a weighting function: as s increases from 0 to 1, the model becomes more and more likely to become a dense graph and less and less likely to include sparse gene network structure. This is why s can be affected by altering the tuning parameter λ. The workflow of our second strategy is as follows:, Permute the observed expression levels of all genes once., Construct the gene network from the permuted expression level data from the first step with the regularization parameter value λ., Estimate the probability s with the sparsity level of the constructed network depending on the value of the regularization parameter λ. The sparsity level s can be computed by dividing the number of edges of the graph by the maximum possible number of edges (p2−p)/2⁠. We denote this estimation with s^(λ)⁠., Generate copies of the E-R graph G(p,s^(λ)) and identify the number of communities k^G(λ) in each copy to evaluate the expected number of communities E{k(λ)}⁠, detected by chance, as the mean value of the copies of k^G(λ)⁠., Repeat steps 1–4 for each value of λ., We define E^G{k(λ)} as the estimator of the expected number of communities under the null hypothesis computed with the E-R graph resampling process, where the edge inclusion probability is equal to the sparsity level s(λ)⁠. Hence, instead of finding the number of communities under the null hypothesis using data permutations, we simulate E-R graphs which are much faster. Note that we propose to use just one permutation of the data to estimate the parameter s to ease the computational complexity of the second strategy. The simulation results presented in the next section indicate that the gap-com statistics computed with the first and the second strategy are practically the same. Therefore, it seems that just steps 4 and 5 of the second strategy need to be repeated. This decreases the time complexity of the second strategy substantially. See also Fig. 2 where we illustrate the gap-com statistic computed applying the E-R model strategy. As one can see, both Figs. 1 and 2 are almost identical and Gap(λ) is maximized with the same threshold parameter. This suggests that both strategies are very similar while the second one is faster than the first strategy. However, it is easy to mitigate the computational expense of both of the strategies with parallel computing. We have illustrated how parallel computing can reduce the time needed to compute the gap-com model selection criterion in Fig. 3., E-R model strategy. In this toy example, the ground truth graph is a star-graph with 100 distinct hubs (stars) (p = 500, n = 1,000). We use hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute sparse network estimates. a) Curves of k(λ) (blue solid line) and reference E^G{k(λ)} (red dashed line) are both determined with the Walktrap community detection algorithm as a function of the hard-threshold parameter λ. b) Gap-com curve as a function of estimated k. We generated 50 copies of the E-R graph to estimate E{k(λ)}⁠. The vertical dashed line in the left-hand figure corresponds to the parameter value that maximizes Gap(λ)⁠. The vertical dashed line in the right-hand figure corresponds to the true number of hubs., E-R model strategy.

We use hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute sparse network estimates. a) Curves of k(λ) (blue solid line) and reference E^G{k(λ)} (red dashed line) are both determined with the Walktrap community detection algorithm as a function of the hard-threshold parameter λ. b) Gap-com curve as a function of estimated k.

The vertical dashed line in the right-hand figure corresponds to the true number of hubs., The elapsed times of both resampling strategies as a function of parallel threads. We use the hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute the sparse network estimates (p = 1,000, n = 200). We set the number of permutations to 50 in the first strategy and likewise generated 50 copies of the E-R graphs to evaluate the gap-com statistic., The elapsed times of both resampling strategies as a function of parallel threads. We use the hard thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to compute the sparse network estimates (p = 1,000, n = 200). We set the number of permutations to 50 in the first strategy and likewise generated 50 copies of the E-R graphs to evaluate the gap-com statistic., We choose λ which maximizes Gap(λ) as presented in (3). The tuning parameter chosen with the gap-com statistic has an easily understandable interpretation: the selected sparse graphical model reflects the complex clustering structure of the gene co-expression network which differs from the co-expression network whose pairwise gene-by-gene relationships are determined just by chance., The value of the regularization parameter λ, which maximizes Gap(λ)⁠, might not be unique if the data strongly supports a specific number of clusters (Kuismin et al. 2017). However, the network models which maximizes Gap(λ) with different values of λ are usually not isomorphic. We do not want to miss interesting network characteristics (hubs and clusters) but we still want to reduce the number of false-positive edges (co-expression relationships which are estimated as significant but are not so in reality). In such case, we choose the regularization parameter value which produces a network model with the smallest sparsity level (the simplest model principle/parsimony principle), more generally: choose the tuning parameter value λ which produces the simplest network model such that Gap(λ)≥Gap(λ′), λ≠λ′⁠., In addition to the tuning parameter λ, the gap-com statistic depends on the community detection algorithm used to find the number of communities (k). For the sake of clarity, we use just one community detection method to illustrate the gap-com statistic. In particular, we use the Walktrap algorithm with the gap-com statistic to determine the number of clusters in a constructed network. Walktrap uses random walks and encodes results of the walks into a dendrogram. Then one can use the modularity score to decide the optimal community structure of the network (the cutoff of the dendrogram). Although the Walktrap algorithm is computationally quite expensive, it has been shown that it correspond closely to the ground truth communities (Danon et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2016) similar to the performance of the multilevel algorithm which is not discussed in this study (Blondel et al. 2008)., To illustrate the performance of gap-com in graphical model selection, we generate artificial test data from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a zero mean vector and a precision matrix whose sparsity structure depends on 3 different undirected complex network models, and one random model without a clear clustering structure. The simulation models are the following:, A cluster-graph with 10 disjoint clusters., A star-graph with 10 disjoint stars., The Barabási–Albert network model (or shortly the random scale-free graph)., The E-R network model G(p,s=0.263) (or shortly as random graph)., We examine the case where p = 500., This cluster-graph consists of 10 disjoint E-R networks G(p,s=0.3) where the probability parameter s is set as 0.3 which is the default value of the R-package huge (version 1.3.2) (Zhao et al. 2012). The Barabási–Albert model does not generate disconnected clusters leading to ambiguous community detection. Nevertheless, it is an important class of complex networks, so we use it to illustrate how the gap-com statistic works when the underlying complex network shows no clear clustering structure. On the other hand, the E-R graph is known to show very low or no clustering at all. Although this graphical model might not represent real-world gene co-expression network structure we use it in this simulation example to illustrate that the model selection criteria do force clustering structure into the network model in case there is no clear clustering structure present. In the E-R graph model G(p,s)⁠, we set the parameter s as 0.263. We choose this value experimentally. The graph generated with this value has just a few clusters detected with the Walktrap algorithm in our simulations. In particular, we detected 5 unique communities with the Walktrap algorithm in the graph simulated with the E-R graph model., As mentioned earlier, test data sets are generated under the complex network models described above using the R package huge. We use n = 200 samples to estimate the sparsity pattern of precision and correlation matrices used to construct different networks (ratio n/p is equal to 0.4). The number of features commonly exceeds the number of observations by far in high-dimensional gene co-expression relationship estimation. For example, in Schäfer and Strimmer (2005) authors examined a breast cancer data set with 3,883 genes and 49 samples (⁠n/p=0.0130⁠) (West et al. 2001). We have set the sample size so that we obtain comparable results with all the model selection methods (see below)., We use 2 methods to estimate the pairwise relationships of the simulated random variables: hard thresholding (see, e.g. Horvath 2011) and BigQuic (hereafter BQ) (Hsieh et al. 2013). We choose these methods because they are the most suitable ones for large-scale (say, tens of thousands of nodes) network construction. Moreover, hard thresholding represents a correlation network construction tool and BQ a GGM construction tool. Both methods are publicly available in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and implemented in packages huge and BigQuic. We use 50 different regularization parameter values for both methods. In addition, we restrict the largest sparsity level of the network models considered here to 0.1 when the hard-thresholding is used to construct the sparse network from simulated data., To illustrate the gap-com statistic, we generate 50 data permutations and 50 copies of the E-R graph to evaluate E{k(λ)} under the null hypothesis while using the Walktrap algorithm to detect clusters in a network model. We call the gap-com statistic utilizing data permutation strategy and the gap-com statistic computed using E-R graph resampling strategy “gap-com (perm)” and “gap-com (E-R),” respectively. We set the length of the random walk to four for the Walktrap algorithm and choose the optimal number of communities based on the highest modularity score., For comparison, we also performed graphical model selection using three other model selection criteria to compare these graphical models with the graphical models selected with the gap-com statistic: StARS (Liu et al. 2010), path connectivity (PC), and AGlommerative NESted (AGNES) (Mestres et al. 2018). StARS is also based on resampling of the observed data and we thus generated 50 subsamples for StARS. StARS incorporates an extra tuning parameter to control the sparsity of the selected sparse network. We set it as 0.05 which is the default value proposed by Liu et al. (2010). PC compares the change between geodesic distance mean statistics of 2 consecutive sparse models (corresponding to 2 consecutive tuning parameter values). PC criterion chooses the model where the change in graph complexity is at its peak and this is like the gap statistic, but PC is not based on resampling. AGNES chooses the graphical model which maximizes an agglomeration coefficient (AC). We note that the above-mentioned graphical model selection criteria are general methods which work with any network estimator. In this illustrative example, our strategy is to choose the “best” model among the same collection of sparse network models. Thus, 2 different criteria can select the same sparse network model., While comparing these 5 model selection criteria with each other, we wanted to examine how accurately the selected edges reflect the structure of the underlying true complex graphical model and how the estimated communities correspond to the known community structure computed from the ground truth network with the Walktrap algorithm., We use the following binary classification metrics to compare the selected network model edge-wise to the ground truth network:where TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives, TP is the number of true positives and FN is the number of false negatives. We define Pre = 0 and MCC = 0 if TP+FP=0⁠. Sensitivity and precision can vary between 0 and 1 and MCC between –1 and 1. The closer the values of Sen, Pre and MCC are to one, the better the model performance is., Sensitivity Sen =TP/(TP+FN)⁠., Precision Pre =TP/(TP+FP)⁠., Mathew correlation coefficient MCC =γ×β−0.5⁠, where γ=(TP×TN−FP×FN) and β=(TP+FP)×(TP+FN)×(TN+FP)×(TN+FN)⁠,, We report the results of Sen, Pre, MCC, and NMI in Tables 1 and 2 averaged over 100 simulation replications. We also report the average number (median) and the interquartile range (IQR) of the number of unique communities the Walktrap algorithm identified from each selected network model. Because both the hard thresholding and BigQuic return a very sparse support for the graphical models, we removed isolated nodes (nodes with zero degree) from the graphical model selected with gap-com, StARS, PC, and AGNES to ease the interpretation of the results. We denote the number of identified communities after removal of isolated nodes with “# Clusters.”, Averaged model evaluation metrics of binary classification tests (mean), NMI (mean), and the number of clusters [median (IQR) after isolated nodes are removed] over 100 replications from different sparse network models while using hard thresholding (Threshold) when p = 500 and n = 200., The highest averaged value are boldfaced in each column. The true numbers of communities are 10, 10, 40, and 5 of the cluster, star, scale-free, and the random graph model, respectively., Averaged model evaluation metrics of binary classification tests (mean), NMI (mean), and the number of clusters [median (IQR) after isolated nodes are removed] over 100 replications from different sparse network models while using hard thresholding (Threshold) when p = 500 and n = 200., The highest averaged value are boldfaced in each column.

The true numbers of communities are 10, 10, 40, and 5 of the cluster, star, scale-free, and the random graph model, respectively., Here, we infer a co-expression network from an expression data set of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (hereafter S. aureus) used previously in the DREAM5 (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) network inference challenge (Marbach et al. 2012). Overall, there are expression levels of 2,810 genes for 160 samples. From these 2,810 genes, about 5% are decoy genes introduced by randomly selecting gene expression values from the compendium itself (see Supplementary Note 1 of Marbach et al. 2012). Genes were anonymized for the original DREAM5 challenge, but true gene IDs are available on the DREAM Challenges homepage. The underlying network is unknown, but we assume that the genes interact with each other so that they form nontrivial co-expression relationships. There are in total 99 potential transcription factors (TFs) from which 9 are decoy genes (false positives). The expression data have been uniformly normalized., We note that in the original work of Marbach et al. (2012) authors examined regulatory interactions between genes (gene regulatory networks) and we examine a co-expression network. However, these 2 network classes could somehow be related (Xulvi-Brunet and Li 2010). Here we briefly compare these networks with each other. In particular, we inspect a network community which corresponds to a module of 27 genes identified in Marbach et al. (2012) that is highly enriched for pathogenic genes. Hereafter, we refer to this community as Pathogen module., We use hard-thresholding of pairwise correlation coefficients to control the sparsity of the gene co-expression network and test 50 different hard-threshold cutoff values in the co-expression network construction. We restrict the largest sparsity level of the gene co-expression network models considered here to 0.3.

son. Again, we use the Walktrap algorithm to identify clusters from the constructed network models and set the length of the random walk in the Walktrap algorithm to 4. We simulate 100 E-R graphs while applying the gap-com statistic (the second strategy) and 100 subsamples while utilizing StARS. We set the extra tuning parameter of StARS criterion to 0.2. As pre-processing, we modify the gene expression levels using the nonparanormal transformation (Liu et al. 2012), also provided in the R package huge, to ease the assumption of normality in our analysis., In addition to the pathogen community, we examined how the inferred hub nodes correspond to genes that are potential TFs for the S.aureus network. We list the first 100 hub nodes, which correspond to the set of the 99 given TFs in Table 3. We also examined the most connected hub nodes (hub genes). We have reported the first 10 of the most connected genes in Table 4., The first of the 100 most connected nodes which correspond to potential TFs of the DREAM5 S. aureus network., The first of the 100 most connected nodes which correspond to potential TFs of the DREAM5 S. aureus network., The first 10 of the most connected genes (nonzero degree) according to their degrees in the DREAM5 S. aureus networks by the model selection criterion., The graph selected with StARS is left out because all nodes in the graph had a degree of zero., The first 10 of the most connected genes (nonzero degree) according to their degrees in the DREAM5 S. aureus networks by the model selection criterion., The graph selected with StARS is left out because all nodes in the graph had a degree of zero., The averaged simulation results of both gap-com strategies are practically identical. The E-R model strategy seems to be an efficient way to compute the gap-com statistic in terms of model recovery and computational cost. We also collected the tuning parameter values selected in each simulation round. The values selected with both gap-com strategies were almost identical. On the other hand, the tuning parameters selected with different model selection criteria were somewhat different on average (see the Supplementary Materials)., Remarkably, the network model selected using the gap-com statistic returns the highest averaged NMI estimates when the ground truth network is generated using the Barabási–Albert model (scale-free network). Except for this, there is no striking difference between the model selection criteria used in this example. For example, the median number of communities identified from the data constructed using the star-graph was exactly ten for all the methods after the isolated nodes were removed from the selected graphs. All criteria have difficulties to detect the structure of the E-R model. For example, the averaged values of precision and MCC are really low (see Tables 1 and 2). We recall that the model selected with StARS depends on an extra tuning parameter and this hyperparameter is usually not tuned during the StARS process. The gap-com statistic, PC and AGNES can estimate the quality of a collection of network models over several tuning parameters during the model selection process., To test how the methods are affected when there are “orphan nodes” (nodes with zero degree) in the ground truth network, we repeated the previous simulation example but this time we removed 25% of the edges in the ground truth network models at random. In this re-run, we used just the hard-thresholding and 50 simulation replications. When there are orphan nodes in the ground truth network, the averaged NMI values associated with gap-com strategies and PC increased and are very similar. Moreover, averaged NMI values associated with gap-com strategies and PC are closer to one compared to other model selection criteria. The estimated values of precision, sensitivity, and MCC changed also but the “ranking” of the model selection criteria was practically identical to the one presented in Tables 1 and 2. See the Supplementary materials for graphical illustration of these additional simulation results., Finally, we tested how the gap-com statistic depends on the choice of the community detection algorithm. We generated data from the star, cluster, and the Barabási–Albert model and computed the gap-com statistic using the Walktrap, the Fast and Greedy (Clauset et al. 2004), and the Propagating labels (Raghavan et al. 2007) community detection algorithms. Overall, although the gap-com statistic and the corresponding tuning parameter value are different when the community detection algorithm is changed, there is no striking difference between the averaged NMI values between these community detection algorithms. The detailed results are shown in the Supplementary Materials., For graphical illustration of all simulation results (e.g. more detailed dispersion metrics), see the Supplementary Materials., There are 137 clusters in the sparse co-expression network when the gap-com statistic is used as the model selection criterion (see also Fig. 4). Note that Fig. 4 gives the impression that there are numerous identical gap-com statistic values which are also maximal. However, there are only 3 identical values which maximize Gap(λ)⁠, although this might not be clearly visible in Fig. 4. We choose the co-expression network model with the smallest sparsity level following the parsimony principle. As noted by Tibshirani et al. (2001) it is important to examine the whole gap curve in case there is cluster structure which does not maximize the gap statistic but is visible as multiple local maxima on the curve. In this particular case a wider range of tuning parameter values (roughly in the interval [0.37,0.60]⁠) might also represent a group of competing network models. Thus, choosing the co-expression network model corresponding, e.g. to the tuning parameter value 0.6 could arguably be justified in this case., The gap-com statistic used to determine the optimal value of the tuning parameter for sparse network estimate of the DREAM5 S. aureus network (the vertical dashed line). The gap-com statistic is maximized with a tuning parameter value resulting in 137 clusters in the network. From these indentified clusters 4 contain more than single nodes. The standard errors are illustrated with horizontal lines around the corresponding values of Gap(λ)⁠., The gap-com statistic used to determine the optimal value of the tuning parameter for sparse network estimate of the DREAM5 S. aureus network (the vertical dashed line). The gap-com statistic is maximized with a tuning parameter value resulting in 137 clusters in the network. From these indentified clusters 4 contain more than single nodes. The standard errors are illustrated with horizontal lines around the corresponding values of Gap(λ)⁠., There are 133 isolated nodes in the network selected with the gap-com statistic. The Walktrap identified 688 clusters (513 isolated nodes) from the co-expression network selected with PC and 129 clusters (114 isolated nodes) from the network selected with AGNES. None of the criteria selected the same sparse co-expression network model. The sparsity-levels of different network estimates were as follows: gap-com, 13.469%; StARS, 0.000%; PC, 0.612%; and AGNES, 30.000%. The total number of possible edges in the graph is 3,946,645. StARS selected a drastically sparse graph with only one edge. One can change this by either (1) increasing the extra tuning parameter of the StARS procedure even further (relaxing the sparsity assumption) or (2) using some other method to estimate the parameters of the co-expression network model. Nevertheless, we leave the results as they are to illustrate the difference between the model selection criteria we have used., Co-expression nodes corresponding to the pathogen module in the network models selected using the gap-com statistic and AGNES share similar characteristics in the gap-com graphs and the AGNES graphs. The pathogen module constructed from the graph selected with PC was very sparse and the number of edges of PC Pathogen module is 19. Nodes (genes) of these Pathogen modules share many similarities with the community network shown in Marbach et al. (2012). For example, 10 neighbors out of the 11 neighbors of SAV2357 (transcription regulator) in the gap-com graph and 14 genes out of the 20 neighbors in the AGNES graph are also neighbors of SAV2357 in the Pathogen module. In addition, 9 out of 10 of the neighbors of SAV2553 (tetracycline repressor) in the gap-com graph are also neighbors of SAV2553 in the Pathogen module and they cover the whole neighborhood of the community network Pathogen module (with one false positive). Moreover, the Walktrap algorithm places the neighborhood of SAV2553 in the same community. The high-quality figures of the pathogenic module selected using the gap-com statistic, StARS, PC, and AGNES are found in the Supplementary Materials., None of the methods identified exactly the same set of hub genes. The SAV0996 gene is the top hub gene in the networks selected using the gap-com statistic and the second highest hub node in the network selected using AGNES. The list of the neighborhood of the SAV0996 gene detected in the gap-com network are found in the Supplementary Materials. There are no decoy genes among the top 100 hub genes in the co-expression network estimates selected with the gap-com statistic, PC, and AGNES., The pre-processing of the data matters in this analysis but without deeper knowledge about the data we cannot examine how this affects different network construction methods [see Supplementary Note 10.3 of Marbach et al. (2012)]., We have proposed a novel gap statistic in a new context that allows the detection of the upper-level hierarchy structure of the sparse network model (the number of network communities). Using the random graph model to estimate the expected number of clusters under the E-R model is more time efficient compared with the data permutation strategy and the graphical models selected with either of these strategies are practically the same. In addition, parallel computing can considerably reduce the running time of the gap-com procedure., Finding gene clusters and hub genes from a complex gene co-expression network are demanding problems. Moreover, there is no mathematically unified definition for a network community (see Fortunato 2010, pp. 83–84) which leaves the detection of representative clusters open to interpretation. Like the original gap statistic, the gap-com statistic depends on the method used to construct the undirected graphical model and on the community detection algorithm. This results in numerous combinations of estimation procedures and community detection algorithms which have direct influence on the final graphical model selected with the gap-com statistic., In this study, we have concentrated on undirected complex network models with a clear cluster structure. It would be interesting to try how the gap-com statistic works if one considers overlapping or hierarchical communities in the community detection algorithm. As far as we know, no other graphical model selection criterion can take overlapping communities into account. This would be an interesting direction for future studies, considering that our simulations with the Barabási–Albert model illustrate that the gap-com statistic returns a sensible network model although the unambiguous cluster structure is not considered., While not discussed in this study, the gap-com statistic is readily applicable to weighted graphs and for discrete data. It would be straightforward to apply the gap-com statistic in a setting where the overall structure and sparsity of the complex network is controlled with multiple hyperparameters. For example, in the work of Liu and Ihler (2011), the authors propose an additional power law regularization to estimate non-zero entries of sparse precision matrices that can be used to construct a gene co-expression network with a hub structure. One could use the gap-com statistic to select the regularization coefficients of this approach., A demo script and R codes for reproducing all the analyses and figures represented in this study are available at GitHub under the GPL license, https://github.com/markkukuismin/gap-com.

Our findings highlight a differential diversity-level and evolutionary dynamics of the YR retrotransposons in X. tropicalis and X. laevis species expanding our comprehension of the behavior of these elements in both genomes during the diversification process., Transposable elements (TEs) are the most variable feature of the vertebrate genome, and their role in shaping genomic diversity has attracted considerable interest in recent years (Bourque et al. 2018; Wicker et al. 2018). An exceptional diversity of TEs has been reported in all the amphibian genomes sequenced so far (Hellsten et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2015; Session et al. 2016; Hammond et al. 2017; Edwards et al. 2018; Seidl et al. 2019). In Xenopus tropicalis, a model organism for genomic studies, TEs represent approximately one-third of the genome (Hellsten et al. 2010). Despite the considerable abundance of TEs in genome annotation, the diversity, molecular structure, and evolutionary dynamics of these elements are still poorly understood. The DIRS elements are a good example of this richness that has not been explored., Retrotransposons of the order DIRS are widely distributed in eukaryote genomes (Wicker et al. 2007), except for the birds and mammals (Poulter and Butler 2015). The unifying feature of these elements is that they encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), which participates in the process of integrating the element into the genome (Poulter and Butler 2015). Other retrotransposons employ endonucleases (LINEs and PLEs) or DDE-type integrase [long terminal repeats (LTRs)] (Wicker et al. 2007)., The DIRS elements were named in recognition of the first retrotransposon containing YR to be described, DIRS-1, which was found in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (Cappello et al. 1985). This order can be divided into four superfamilies based on sequence structure and phylogeny: DIRS-like, Ngaro-like, PAT-like, and VIPER-like (Ribeiro et al. 2019). In general, the DIRS elements have three open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF corresponds to a gag-like domain, the second corresponds to the reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNAse H (RH), and the third corresponds to the YR. Another characteristic of these elements is that the ORFs frequently overlap and have terminal repeats that vary in structure among the superfamilies (Poulter and Goodwin 2005; Ribeiro et al. 2019)., The DIRS-like elements can present a conserved methyltransferase (MT) domain downstream from the RT/RH, although the function of this domain is still unknown (Goodwin et al. 2004; Poulter and Butler 2015). The noncoding portion varies in its sequence among the elements, although its basic structure is composed of inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and an internal complementary region (ICR), which is complementary to the beginning of ITR5′ and the end of the ITR3′ (Cappello et al. 1985; Poulter and Butler 2015)., The Ngaro-like elements were described after the DIRS-like and are distinguished by their split direct repeats (SDR), composed of A1 in the 5′ end and B1, A2, and B2 in the 3′ end, where A1 and A2 are identical, as are B1 and B2 (Goodwin et al. 2004). These elements do not contain the MT-like domain found in the DIRS-like, although in amphibians, they contain an ORF encoding a hydrolase domain (Hydro–SGNH) after the YR, but with no proven function (Goodwin and Poulter 2004; Poulter and Butler 2015)., The PAT-like elements are phylogenetically closely related to the DIRS-like elements (Goodwin and Poulter 2001; Goodwin and Poulter 2004; Poulter and Goodwin 2005), although these two groups are not always monophyletic (Ribeiro et al. 2019), and they can be differentiated by structural variations in the terminal repeats. Such as for Ngaro-like, PAT-like elements are composed of SDRs (Poulter and Goodwin 2005; Ribeiro et al. 2019). The VIPER-like elements also have SDRs, and form a distinct group of retrotransposons restricted to the protozoans of the order Kinetoplastida (Ribeiro et al. 2019)., In the Anura, both DIRS-like and Ngaro-like elements have been described in X. tropicalis and Xenopus laevis (Goodwin et al. 2004; Hellsten et al. 2010; Poulter and Butler 2015). These species are found across sub-Saharan Africa and have an aquatic life that distinguishes them from other anurans (Hellsten et al. 2010). The X. tropicalis karyotype is composed of 2n = 20 chromosomes with an estimated genome size of 1.7 Gbp (Hellsten et al. 2010), while the X. laevis karyotype has a diploid number of 2n = 36 chromosomes, which originated from a process of allopolyploidy, with an estimated size of 3.1 Gbp where the two subgenomes (called S and L) are identified (Session et al. 2016). The available estimates indicate that 1% of the X. tropicalis genome is composed of distinct families of DIRS, some of which may still be active (Hellsten et al. 2010). Evidence of the transcriptional activity of the DIRS elements has already been found in both species (Poulter and Butler 2015), which highlights the possible role of these elements in genome function and evolution., In the present study, we evaluated the diversity, molecular structure, and evolutionary dynamics of the elements of the order DIRS in X. tropicalis and X. laevis. We identified the structural characteristics of the YR retrotransposons of the DIRS order in both genomes, and described diagnostic characteristics for the best differentiation of the elements of the DIRS-like and Ngaro-like and evaluated the evolutionary dynamics of these superfamilies in these genomes., An extract containing all the elements identified as DIRS was obtained from the Rebpase database (Jurka 2000) version 23.11. All the sequences from X. tropicalis and X. laevis were selected and analyzed using the NCBI “Open Reading Frame Finder” (ORFfinder) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/) to identify ORFs with default parameters [“minimal ORF length (nt)” = 75; “Genetic code”: 1. Standard; “ORF start codon to use”: ATG only]. The presence of conserved domains was analyzed using the NCBI “Conserved Domains Search Service” (CD-Search) (Marchler-Bauer and Bryant 2004) with an e-value threshold adjusted to 0.1. The presence of ITRs, ICRs, and SDRs was investigated using NCBI BLASTn with the same sequence as query and subject, selecting the options “Align two or more sequences” and “somewhat similar sequences (blastn)”, with the “word size” parameter being adjusted to the minimum available for each sequence and the e-value threshold was 10., Three families of X. tropicalis were selected for the analysis of copies in the genome, including one DIRS-like family (DIRS-37_XT) and two Ngaro-like families (DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT). We chose the DIRS-37_XT and DIRS-53_XT families as queries because they have the conserved structure of the ORFs and the complete domains, as well as the characteristic repeats for each superfamily. The DIRS-54_XT family was also used as a query to expand the searches of Ngaro-like even despite not having conserved terminal repeats., The amino acid (aa) sequences corresponding to the RTs of both elements were used as queries in online tBLASTn searches against the X. tropicalis (GCA_000004195.4) and X. laevis (GCA_017654675.1) genomes. The first 10 hits were retrieved with 3 kb of both upstream and downstream regions. All the copies retrieved were analyzed for the identification of the ORFs, the conserved domains, and the repetitive regions as described above., The evolutionary analyses were based on the alignment of the RT aa sequences, including the following sequences: (1) the consensus sequences of the DIRS families of X. laevis and X. tropicalis recovered from Rebpase; (2) the copies that are homologous to the DIRS-37_XT, DIRS-53_XT, and DIRS-54_XT families retrieved from the X. tropicalis and X. laevis genomes; and (3) elements known to belong to the different superfamilies of the order DIRS, Ngaro-like—Ngaro1_DR (AY152729—Danio rerio) and Lv_Ngaro2 (AGCV01398517—Lytechinus variegatus), PAT-like—SkowPAT (Rebpase—Saccoglossus kowalevskii), and PAT (Q26106—Panagrellus redivivus), and DIRS-like—DIRS-1_Acar (Rebpase—Anolis carolinensis) and DIRS-5_CBP (Rebpase—Chrysemys picta bellii)., The sequences were aligned using the PSI-coffee tool (Notredame et al. 2000), with Genedoc 2.7 (Nicholas and Nicholas 1997) being used for sequence manipulation and editing. Most of the RT sequences contained around 120 aa, and sequences with less than 70% coverage were excluded from the matrix. The MegaX program (Kumar et al. 2018) was used to determine the best aa substitution model. A distance tree was constructed using the Neighbor-joining method with JTT + G model and bootstrap test with 1000 replicates. A phylogenetic tree was also reconstructed using Bayesian inference, run in MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012) based on the LG + G model. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo was run for 10,000,000 generations, sampled every 1000 generations, with 25% of the initial results being discarded as burn-in. The final trees were visualized and edited using iTOL (Letunic and Bork 2019)., The copies were named a priori according to the family used as the query, abbreviated to D37, D53, and D54, followed by the number of the copy referring to the order in which the sequence was recovered, while “XT” and “XL” are acronyms for X. tropicalis and X. laevis, respectively., For the evolutionary landscape analysis, the consensus sequences available in the Repbase for each DIRS-like family of X. tropicalis and X. laevis and each Ngaro-like family of X. tropicalis were used to compose the libraries of each species. In the case of the Ngaro-like elements of X. laevis, as the families were not available in the Rebpase, the consensus sequences were obtained from the copies recovered in the genomic search described above. For that, the sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.471, with the pairwise divergence being assessed using Genedoc 2.7 (Nicholas and Nicholas 1997) separating the sequences with more than 80% divergence into distinct groups (considering as different families). The consensus sequence of each group was obtained using UGENE (simple extended algorithm) with a 50% threshold (Okonechnikov et al. 2012). The DIRS-like and Ngaro-like libraries of each species were used to screen the genomes using RepeatMasker 4.1.0 (with the “-s,” “-nolow,” “-no_is,” “-a,” and “-lib” options). For X. laevis, the subgenomes S and L were screened separately. RepeatMasker utility Perl scripts were used to summarize the output (script buildSummary.pl) and to calculate Kimura 2-Parameter (K) divergence with adjusted CpG (script calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl). The scatter plot graphs representing the repeat evolutionary landscape were created using the Python Matplotlib-v3.3.2 (Hunter 2007) and edited in Inkscape software., The age of the copies was estimated based on the time since the divergence of the ancestral sequence (since the consensus of each family used in the RepeatMasker is an approximation of its ancestor) using the formula: T = K/r (Jiang et al. 2002), where a divergence (K) was obtained as described above, and r is the nucleotide substitution rate of 3.1 × 10−9 substitutions per year, which is the average of the estimated substitution rates for X. tropicalis and X. laevis, and for the L and S subgenera of X. laevis (Session et al. 2016)., In order to investigate which families are being expressed in X. tropicalis and X. laevis, the expressed sequence tags (EST) library (Bowes et al. 2010) from both species were retrieved from Xenbase (http://www.xenbase.org/, RRID: SCR_003280) and the different DIRS families of both species were used as queries in BLASTn. The results were filtered by identity (>85%) and size (>100 bp)., A total of 75 YR-retroelement families were identified in the Rebpase for X. tropicalis and 20 for X. laevis (Supplementary Table S1). In the Repbase classification, all YR-containing elements are classified as superfamily DIRS, a final group within the LTR retrotransposons group (Kapitonov and Jurka 2008). Mainly concerning the YR elements, the Wicker et al. (2007) classification is more detailed, separating them into a distinct group of retrotransposons (order DIRS) and discriminating the clear distinct subgroups of DIRS into three superfamilies and more recently separation into four superfamilies has been suggested (Ribeiro et al. 2019). We thus previously assume that these DIRS families available in the Repbase could belong to any of the DIRS superfamilies, then our analyses indicate they belong only to DIRS-like and Ngaro-like., The evolutionary trees based on the RT domain of all the elements present similar topologies and recovered two well-supported clades (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1) in which all the Xenopus sequences grouped in either (1) a DIRS-like or (2) a Ngaro-like group. The two PAT-like sequences were not grouped as a monophyletic group., Sequence tree produced by neighbor-joining method (JTT + G), based on the amino acid sequences of the reverse transcriptase domain. The matrix was composed of the sequences of X. tropicalis and X. laevis DIRS elements obtained from the Rebpase database, the copies retrieved from both genomes and diagnostic sequences from each DIRS superfamily. The bootstrap values higher than 50 are indicated at the branches. The * sign near the nodes indicates the clade was supported with posterior probability higher than 80 in the Bayesian tree. Sequences of different superfamilies are highlighted in different colors and shades of each color also distinguish the sequences of X. tropicalis (XT) and X. laevis (XL)., Sequence tree produced by neighbor-joining method (JTT + G), based on the amino acid sequences of the reverse transcriptase domain.

Sequences of different superfamilies are highlighted in different colors and shades of each color also distinguish the sequences of X. tropicalis (XT) and X. laevis (XL)., The divergence between these two groups of sequences is clear (Figure 1). We recognized only two of the 95 Xenopus Rebpase DIRS families as belonging to the Ngaro-like superfamily, i.e., DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT. Sequences from the families DIRS-6A_XT, DIRS-13C_XT, DIRS-27A_XT, DIRS-35_XT, DIRS-42_XT, DIRS-3_XL, DIRS-10_XL, DIRS-13_XL, DIRS-15_XL, DIRS-18_XL, and DIRS-19_XL were not included in the tree because the RT domain was too short, but all these elements present a DIRS-like terminal repeat pattern., The sequences of both superfamilies were analyzed, and a high level of congruence was found in the sequence structure in comparison with the DIRS families described in vertebrates (Goodwin and Poulter 2004) (Figure 2). These findings will be discussed below., Schematic structure of the potentially complete DIRS-like and Ngaro-like retroelements of the Xenopus tropicalis genome. (A) Representation of the X. tropicalis DIRS-like elements, based on the Rebpase consensus sequences of the DIRS-37_XT, that contain three ORFs, conserved domains (gag, RT/RH/MT, and YR) and noncoding portions: inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and internal complementary regions (ICRs). The expanded scheme of the terminal regions is shown in the lower plot. (B) Representation of the X. tropicalis Ngaro-like elements based on the Rebpase consensus sequences of the DIRS-53_XT that contain four ORFs, conserved domains (RT/RH, YR, and SGNH) and split direct repeats (SDRs)., Schematic structure of the potentially complete DIRS-like and Ngaro-like retroelements of the Xenopus tropicalis genome.

(B) Representation of the X. tropicalis Ngaro-like elements based on the Rebpase consensus sequences of the DIRS-53_XT that contain four ORFs, conserved domains (RT/RH, YR, and SGNH) and split direct repeats (SDRs)., The Repbase sequences of the DIRS-like superfamily found in the X. tropicalis and X. laevis genomes range from 4146 base pairs (bp) in DIRS-33_XT to 6224 bp in DIRS-2A_XT. We recognized three ORFs in almost all the families with several levels of overlap, involving primarily ORF2 and ORF3 (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, for more details)., The ORF1 encodes a gag-like protein and a LAP2alpha domain (∼650 aa) was predicted in all families. The ORF2 corresponds to the RT and RH domains, with around 120 and 356 aa, respectively. A deoxy-adenosine methylase (DAM/MT) domain of around 284 aa was also observed in the ORF2 of 38 of the families evaluated here. The ORF3 encodes the YR protein with a conserved DNA_BRE_C domain of around 584 aa (Supplementary Table S2)., The DIRS-like elements have 5′ and 3′ ITRs and an ICR region (Figure 2A), and this pattern of repeats was found in almost all the Xenopus DIRS-like families evaluated here. The ITRs have ∼120 bp and present a few nucleotide substitutions or indels between the left ITR (lITR) and the right ITR (rITR) (Figure 2A). The ICR is composed of two short sequences (lICR and rICR), which are complementary to the 5′ (lTer) and the 3′ (rTer) ends of the element (Figure 2A). The ICR and ITR sequences overlap slightly in most families., Overall, 36 of the 75 Rebpase DIRS-like families of X. tropicalis present some level of degeneration in the molecular structure of the terminal repeats and/or ORFs domains (Supplementary Table S2). In X. laevis, 13 of the 20 families present premature interruptions in the ORFs or incomplete repeats (Supplementary Table S2), which indicates a high level of degeneration in these families. Concerning the EST data, we observed that most families present transcripts (55 families from X. tropicalis and 12 families from X. laevis) (Supplementary Table S1). The DIRS-like families of both genomes have characteristic thymine trinucleotides (i.e., “TTT”) in both their 5′ and 3′ ends., The RT sequence tree highlights the high level of family diversity of the DIRS-like clade in Xenopus (Figure 1). The diagnostic DIRS-like sequences from Sauropsids (DIRS-1_ACar and DIRS-5_CBP) were recovered as a basal branch, which indicates that most of DIRS-like families’ diversity was originated after the separation of amniotes and amphibians, although in the BA tree (Supplementary Figure S1), these sequences were located inside the Xenopus DIRS-like clade., As the Rebpase nomenclature of the families established for a species follows the order of their description (Kapitonov and Jurka 2008; Bao et al. 2009), the evolutionary relationships among the families must be interpreted based on their phylogenetic relationships in the sequence trees, rather than their nomenclature in the databases. For example, DIRS-4_XT is not closely related to DIRS-4_XL, whereas DIRS-2_XL and DIRS-50_XT have a very close relationship. We recovered families of DIRS-like that were shared between the two species, such as DIRS-29_XT with DIRS-14_XL + DIRS-17_XL, DIRS-2_XL and DIRS-50_XT, DIRS-11_XL with DIRS-52_XT + DIRS-16_XT, and DIRS-41_XT + DIRS-41A_XT with DIRS-9_XL + DIRS-16_XL., We also observed marked species-specific structuring in the sequence tree, recovering subclades that grouped families only from X. tropicalis or X. laevis. This indicates that many of the families may have originated after the separation of the two species, in particular in X. tropicalis. The evolutionary landscape profile observed in each genome further reinforces this conclusion (Figure 3). For X. laevis, in both subgenomes, it is possible to observe two broad ancient waves of amplification [60–80 million years ago (mya) and 110–135 mya], whereas, in the X. tropicalis genome, there is a peak of very recent amplification, which occurred less than 3.2 mya. The younger copies in X. laevis genome are found in smaller proportions than in X. tropicalis and a small peak of recent amplification is seen around 10 mya. Although the diversity of the DIRS-like families is much lower in X. laevis, they make up a larger proportion of the genome (1.03%) than in X. tropicalis (0.5%) with similar proportion in both subgenomes (0.45% for S subgenome and 0.58% for L subgenome). The families DIRS-2_XL, DIRS-3_XL, DIRS-10_XL, DIRS-12_XL, DIRS-13_XL, and DIRS-14_XL present a slightly higher proportion of mapping (around 60%) in the L genome (Supplementary Figure S2)., Evolution of Xenopus species and evolutionary dynamics of DIRS elements. The evolutionary events as estimated by Session et al. (2016) are shown: the speciation of X. tropicalis and the ancestor of X. laevis at 48 mya, the speciation of the L and S progenitors of X. laevis at 34 mya, and their hybridization around 17–18 mya. The graphs show the divergence of DIRS-like (above) and Ngaro-like (below) copies mapped in the genomes of X. tropicalis and X. laevis (S and L subgenomes) with their consensus sequence expressed in Kimura-2-parameters distance and the corresponding time of divergence in million years (x-axis) plotted in relation to the proportion in the genome (y-axis)., Evolution of Xenopus species and evolutionary dynamics of DIRS elements.

The graphs show the divergence of DIRS-like (above) and Ngaro-like (below) copies mapped in the genomes of X. tropicalis and X. laevis (S and L subgenomes) with their consensus sequence expressed in Kimura-2-parameters distance and the corresponding time of divergence in million years (x-axis) plotted in relation to the proportion in the genome (y-axis)., From potentially active families, we chose to analyze the DIRS-37_XT copies in the genomes. In X. tropicalis, we can observe that most copies recovered (except copies 4 and 6) are putative functional presenting all ORFs and conserved ITRs and ICR. Copies 1–7 are the most closely related and grouped in the clade containing DIRS-37_XT, DIRS-37A_XT, and DIRS-28_XT, but only the copies 1, 2, and 4 grouped with the query. The search has also recovered copies that grouped with more distant families, DIRS-31_XT (copies 8 and 9) and DIRS-3_XT (copy 10)., In X. laevis, the closest described families to DIRS-37_XT are DIRS-14_XL, DIRS-17_XL, and DIRS-2_XL. The nearest sequences to the query are the copies 1, 2, 4, and 5 (copy 3 was not included in the tree) forming a clade with no known family, suggesting that these sequences may be copies of a X. laevis family that has yet to be established. Copies 6–10 grouped with DIRS-12_XL, which is closely related to DIRS-1_XL. We found conserved copies in both subgenomes., The Ngaro-like families DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT also present the three expected ORFs (encoding gag-like elements, RT/RH, and YR) with an additional ORF encoding a protein containing the SGNH_hydrolase domain. The reading frames of all the ORFs overlap (Figure 2B; Supplementary Table S2). The Ngaro-like elements are known to have a different type of terminal repeat, the SDRs (Goodwin and Poulter 2004). This pattern can be observed in the DIRS-53_XT copy (Figure 2B). This element has A1 and A2 repeats of 236 bp and B1 and B2 repeats of 152 bp, both being 100% identical. No SDRs were found in the DIRS-54_XT. Although none of the X. laevis Rebpase DIRS families grouped with Ngaro-like clade, our searches in the genome revealed the presence of sequences homologous to DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT. Ngaro-like transcripts were found for both species (Supplementary Table S1)., The copies of DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT recovered from X. tropicalis genome varied considerably in the degree of conservation of their sequences and structure (Supplementary Table S2), ranging from well-conserved copies to highly degenerate ones, due primarily to the loss of all or part of their 5′ and/or 3′ SDRs. Copies 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9 of DIRS-53_XT and copies 5 and 10 of DIRS-54_XT are potentially active., In X. laevis, we observed that 13 homologous copies of DIRS-53_XT/DIRS-54_XT are preserved, while some include a complete or partial loss of the 5' and/or 3' SDRs or broken ORF (Supplementary Table S2). Copies 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 recovered with DIRS-53_XL and copies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 recovered with DIRS-54_XL are potentially active., The copies recovered from both species were included in the sequence tree (Figure 1; except those with a short RT domain—D53c2XT, D53c5XT, D53c9XT). Clearly, DIRS-53_XT and DIRS-54_XT are very divergent (∼65% over only 600 bp of good alignment) and form two major groups of Ngaro-like sequences; however, some of the relationships were not supported by the bootstrap values and the Bayesian tree (Supplementary Figure S1) has shown a distinct topology, grouping some of the copies recovered with DIRS-54_XT in both species as a basal clade together with DIRS-53_XT. In both trees, the structuring of subclades with species-specific groups suggests the activity of these families after the separation of X. tropicalis and X. laevis. While the SDRs are not present in the consensus canonical copy of DIRS-54_XT, they can be observed in copies 5 and 10, which indicates that this family is also potentially active in X. tropicalis., Similar to what we observed for DIRS-like, Ngaro-like elements density in X. laevis (0.091%) is approximately double of the density seen for X. tropicalis (0.044%) and these proportions are 10 times smaller than observed for DIRS-like in both genomes. The Ngaro-like evolutionary landscape profile (Figure 3) shows a recent amplification signal (less than 3.2 mya) in X. tropicalis genome and X. laevis subgenomes. Additionally, in both species, it is possible to observe a very ancient amplification wave, dating from 120 to 145 mya, that is more prominent in X. laevis graph., In this work, we presented a detailed analysis of the YR-containing elements (order DIRS) available in the Repbase23.11 for X. tropicalis and X. laevis classifying them as either into the DIRS-like or Ngaro-like superfamilies. We have provided a detailed description of the structural characteristics of these elements and found the specific molecular signature of each superfamily. DIRS-like and Ngaro-like elements present distinct diagnostic features in their 5′ and 3′ noncoding terminal regions with the same structural elements already recorded in other metazoans, fungi, and protists (Goodwin and Poulter 2001; Goodwin and Poulter 2004; Poulter and Goodwin 2005; Poulter and Goodwin 2015). Our detailed analysis of the elements corroborates what has been described for these superfamilies concerning the ORFs and domains (Goodwin and Poulter 2001; Poulter and Goodwin 2005). We found the three main ORFs for both superfamilies and a MT domain or a hydrolase domain was found in the DIRS-like and Ngaro-like families, respectively., We also identified conserved thymine trinucleotides (“TTT”) at the 5′ and 3′ ends in the complete copies of the DIRS-like elements of the genomes. This is probably a general pattern of the DIRS-like elements found in terminal regions, which may be essential for transposing these elements (Malicki et al. 2020). A similar terminal signature has also been described for the DrDIRS1 element of Tribolium castaneum, which has either the trinucleotides “GTT” or dinucleotides “AA” (Goodwin et al. 2004). Given this, the recognition of the similarities in the molecular structure of these elements from the two species would also contribute to the assessment of the diversity and evolutionary history of these YR retrotransposons in other anuran genomes., Based on the phylogenetic criteria and molecular structure, we found that both superfamilies are present in both genomes. The presence of DIRS-like and Ngaro-like was already reported for X. tropicalis (Hellsten et al. 2010). On the other hand, for X. laevis (Goodwin and Poulter 2004), the information was not clear and no Ngaro-like family was deposited in the Repbase dataset version that we analyzed. We found a much greater diversity and proportion of elements of the DIRS-like superfamily, in comparison with the Ngaro-like elements, in both genomes. This richness of DIRS-like elements in Xenopus is also higher than that found for the fish D. rerio (12 families) or the reptile A. carolinensis, which has 42 families (Piednoël et al. 2011). DIRS-like and Ngaro-like elements are widely distributed in a number of metazoan groups, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, and some fungus (Ruiz-Perez et al. 1996) and protists (Goodwin and Poulter 2001; Poulter and Goodwin 2005). Although there is no clear report of DIRS elements in some groups of species, we believe that the distribution of these retrotransposons is underestimated since they are frequently classified in the amount of the LTR retrotransposons group in the annotation of repetitive sequences based on the RepeatMasker tool., Several sequences of both superfamilies are structurally complete in X. tropicalis and X. laevis. Thus, it is relevant to compare the evolutionary landscape pattern of these superfamilies in both genomes since these species have undergone distinct evolutionary processes after the split. The speciation of X. tropicalis and the X. laevis ancestor at around 48 mya (Session et al. 2016; Figure 3). The X. laevis had an allotetraploid origin (around 17–18 mya) from two extant diploid progenitors separated at around 34 mya, and currently has two homoeologous subgenomes (L and S). The L and S subgenomes have undergone profound intragenomic diversification, which is compatible with the absence of recombination between the homeologous chromosome pairs of each subgenome since the allotetraploidization event (Session et al. 2016). If we consider the divergence time and evolutionary rates estimated by Session et al. (2016) as the most realistic scenario of the evolutionary history of Xenopus genus, our time-scale estimate of DIRS evolution shows different patterns in X. tropicalis and X. laevis genomes., For DIRS-like, looking at the X. laevis subgenomes graphs, it is possible to suggest that two ancient waves of amplification (60–80 mya and 110–135 mya) have occurred indicating the long-time of persistence of these el",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ments. Considering the time of the species splitting, these waves probably occurred in the ancestor of both species, while these were less clear in X. tropicalis genome, suggesting a higher turnover of degenerate copies in X. tropicalis than in X. laevis after the separation of these species. All families were mapped in both X. laevis subgenomes and for a few families, the genomic density was slightly higher in the subgenome L. It is suggested that the S subgenome has undergone intrachromosomal rearrangements and extensive small-scale deletions that resulted in the reduction of the length of the S chromosomes in comparison with their L homeologs (Session et al. 2016). The small signature of a recent wave of amplification in both subgenomes occurred after the allotetraploid origin of X. laevis resulting in a small proportion of younger copies that have been maintenance preserved for a long-time in X. laevis genome. In X. tropicalis, the DIRS-like amplification waves were more prominent occurring around 16 mya and less than 3.2 mya. The existence of potentially active copies of DIRS-like identified here is in agreement with the evidence of transcriptional activity detected in the transcriptome data on X. tropicalis (Poulter and Butler 2015) and ours searches in the EST libraries of both species (Supplementary Table S1). Recent burst events in both species may also have contributed to the diversification of families in each genome, particularly in X. tropicalis, which is consistent with the strong species-specific grouping seen in the sequence tree., The evolutionary landscape pattern and the phylogenetic trees highlight the relative success of the DIRS-like elements in the Xenopus genomes in comparison with the Ngaro-like superfamily that presents very low diversity and quantity. Ngaro-like had a very ancient amplification wave followed by a long period of senescence. Despite Ngaro-like elements have failed to increase copy number and diversify in Xenopus, some potentially active copies are found in both genomes what is consistent with the very recent amplification wave (less than 3.2 mya) seen in both species. The recent amplification indicates that Ngaro-like copies were maintained as active and somehow silenced for a long period of Xenopus evolution or were recently reactivated or reintroduced in these genomes., It is not clear, however, the reason why the Ngaro-like did not achieve the same success as DIRS-like, but it could be related to the known differences in the transposition mechanism (Poulter and Goodwin 2005) of both superfamilies or to a possible variation in silencing efficiency by the host, while it could also be explained by chance. Still, evidence of the accumulation of DIRS-1 element on centromeres of the D. discoideum genome (Dubin et al. 2010; Malicki et al. 2017) could indicate their role during the centromeric heterochromatin biogenesis in this genome and open new perspectives to future evaluation about their biological significance in their success in Xenopus genomes., The presence of ancient and senescent DIRS copies in both genomes is consistent with “TE cycle life” of the genome (Kidwell and Lisch 2001), in which ancient mobile elements may lose their autonomy and no amplifications occur, with the nucleotide sequences losing their identity, with the senescent elements eventually being deleted or becoming completely divergent. The intragenomic behavior of the TEs depends on the balance between repression and expression, due to the need to avoid a large number of copies becoming a disadvantage for the genome (Bourque et al. 2018). The conservation of the molecular structure of these elements is related directly to these genetic mechanisms, which determine either an increase or loss of TE diversity, depending on the repertoire of TEs, during the genomic evolution of each lineage., So far, this is the most comprehensive work of DIRS retrotransposons in Amphibia being a starting point to guide research on the evolution and functionalities of these retrotransposons in other anuran genomes and in this way solve gaps in evolutionary history not only in the way they behaved during evolution but also in how they influenced their genomes., Supplementary files available at Table S1 contain description of basic features of the DIRS families of Xenopus tropicalis (XT) and X. laevis (XL) deposited in Rebpase. The consensus sequence of each family was evaluated for the presence/absence of complete conserved ORFs containing the expected domains and the presence of complete structure of repeats (ITRs and ICR for DIRS-like and SDRs for Ngaro-like). The presence of ESTs is also shown for each family. Supplementary Table S2 contains summary analyzes of the copies retrieved of the X. tropicalis and X. laevis genomes. Supplementary Figure S1 contains sequence tree produced by Bayesian inference, based on the amino acid sequences of the RT domain. The matrix was composed of the sequences of X. tropicalis and X. laevis DIRS elements obtained from the Rebpase database, the copies retrieved from both genomes and diagnostic sequences from each DIRS superfamily and Supplementary Figure S2 contains the proportion of all X. laevis DIRS-like families in the subgenomes S and L.

We describe an approximate model that can be applied for a variety of MPPs. We have implemented the approach in the R/qtl2 software, and we illustrate its use in applications to publicly available data on Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice., Multiparent populations (MPPs) are valuable resources for the analysis of complex traits (de Koning and McIntyre 2017), including the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL). A wide variety of MPPs have been developed, including heterogeneous stock (HS) in mice (Mott et al. 2000) and rats (Solberg Woods et al. 2010), eight-way recombinant inbred lines (RIL) in mice (Complex Trait Consortium 2004) and Drosophila (King et al. 2012), and multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations in a variety of plant species including Arabidopsis (Kover et al. 2009), wheat (Cavanagh et al. 2008), maize (Dell’Acqua et al. 2015), and rice (Bandillo et al. 2013)., QTL mapping in MPPs can be performed through statistical tests at individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as used in genome-wide association studies. However, many investigators first seek to reconstruct the mosaic of founder haplotypes along the chromosomes of MPP individuals and use this reconstruction to test for association between founder alleles and the quantitative phenotype. This approach was first introduced by Mott et al. (2000) for the analysis of HS mice, implemented in the HAPPY software, and has been continued in packages such as R/mpMap (Huang and George 2011), DOQTL (Gatti et al. 2014), and R/qtl2 (Broman et al. 2019a)., The process of genotype reconstruction in an MPP individual is illustrated in Figure 1. The genotypes in the founder strains (Figure 1A) and the MPP offspring (Figure 1B) are used to calculate the probability of each possible founder genotype at each position along the chromosome (Figure 1C). Thresholding of these probabilities can be used to infer the founder genotypes and the locations of recombination breakpoints (Figure 1D)., Illustration of genotype reconstruction in a 1 Mbp region in a single DO mouse.

Genotypes other than the two shown have negligible probability across the region. (D) Inferred haplotypes in the DO mouse., Such genotype reconstructions are valuable not just for QTL analysis but also for data diagnostics (Broman et al. 2019b). For example, the inferred number of recombination breakpoints is a useful diagnostic for sample quality. Further, the reconstructed genotypes can be used to derive predicted SNP genotypes; comparing these to the observed SNP genotypes can help to identify problems in both samples and SNPs., The probability calculation in Figure 1C depends on a model for the process along MPP chromosomes in Figure 1D. In the HAPPY software for HS mice, Mott et al. (2000) used a model of random mating in a large population. Broman (2005) extended the work of Haldane and Waddington (1931) to derive two-locus genotype probabilities in multiparent RIL. This was later developed for the case of multiparent advanced intercross populations (Broman 2012a, 2012b), including Diversity Outbred (DO) mice (Churchill et al. 2012)., Genotype reconstruction for a variety of MPP designs has been implemented in the R/qtl2 software (Broman et al. 2019a, https://kbroman.org/qtl2). But it can be tedious analytical work to derive the appropriate transition probabilities for each new MPP design that is proposed. An alternative is to develop a more general approach for genotype reconstruction, such as used in the software RABBIT (Zheng et al. 2015). However, this approach has a variety of parameters that can be difficult to specify., Here, we propose a similarly general method for genotype reconstruction in MPPs. We imagine that an MPP was derived from a population of homozygous founder strains at known proportions, αi, followed by n generations of random mating among a large number of mating pairs. We can derive the exact transition probabilities for this situation. The αi should be simple to specify from the MPP design, and the effective number of generations of random mating, n, can be determined by computer simulation, to match the expected density of recombination breakpoints., Our approach has been implemented in R/qtl2. While we currently focus on data with SNP genotype calls, such as from microarrays, our model could potentially be incorporated into methods for genotype imputation from low-coverage sequencing, such as that of Zheng et al. (2018). We illustrate our approach through application to publicly available datasets on DO (Al-Barghouthi et al. 2021) and Collaborative Cross (CC) mice (Srivastava et al. 2017)., For genotype reconstruction in an MPP, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM; see Rabiner 1989). Our basic approach is as described in Broman and Sen (2009, Appendix D) for a biparental cross; the extension to an MPP is straightforward and described below., Consider an MPP derived from k inbred lines. We focus on a single individual, and on a single chromosome with M marker positions (including pseudomarkers: positions between markers at which we have no data but would like to infer the underlying genotype). Let Gm be the underlying genotype at position m. In a homozygous population, such as RIL, the Gm take one of k possible values, the k homozygous genotypes. In a heterozygous population, such as advanced intercross lines (AIL), the Gm take one of (k2)+k possible values, the (k2) heterozygotes and k homozygotes. Let Om be the observed SNP genotype at position m (possibly missing). We assume that the Gm form a Markov chain (that G1,…,Gm−1 are conditionally independent of Gm+1,…,GM⁠, given Gm), and that Om is conditionally independent of everything else, given Gm. The forward-backward algorithm (see Rabiner 1989) takes advantage of the conditional independence structure of the HMM to calculate Pr(Gm|O)⁠., The key parameters in the model are the initial probabilities, πg=Pr(G1=g)⁠, the transition probabilities, tm(g,g′)=Pr(Gm+1=g′ | Gm=g)⁠, and the emission probabilities, em(g)=Pr(Om|Gm=g)⁠. A particular advantage of the HMM for genotype reconstruction is the easy incorporation of a model for genotyping errors (Lincoln and Lander 1992), which is done through the emission probabilities, which condition on the founder SNP genotypes but allow some fixed probability ϵ that the observed SNP genotype in the MPP individual is in error and incompatible with the underlying genotype Gm and the SNP genotypes in the founder lines., The initial and transition probabilities govern the underlying Markov chain, including the relative frequency of founder alleles and the frequency of recombination breakpoints along MPP chromosomes. In principle, these probabilities may be derived on the basis of the crossing design for the MPP. In practice, the transition probabilities can be tedious to derive, and exact calculations may provide no real advantage for genotype reconstruction., Here, we derive the transition probabilities for a generic MPP design, which may then be applied generally. We consider a founder population with k inbred lines in proportions αi, and imagine subsequent generations are produced by random mating with a very large set of mating pairs., Consider a pair of loci separated by a recombination fraction of r (assumed the same in both sexes) and let pij(n) be the probability of that a random haplotype at generation n has alleles i and j. At n = 0, we have just the founding inbred lines, and so pij(0)=αi if i = j and =0 if i≠j⁠., For a heterozygous population (such as HS or DO mice), an individual will have two random such haplotypes. For homozygous population (such as MAGIC), we treat them like doubled haploids, by taking a single random chromosome and doubling it., For the X chromosome, we use the same equations but replace n with (2/3)n⁠, since recombination occurs only in females, so in 2/3 of the X chromosomes. This provides a remarkably tight approximation., You can potentially use the expected number of crossovers to calibrate the number generations of random mating, or the map expansion, which is the relative increase in the number of crossovers. Let R(r) be the chance that a random haplotype has an exchange of alleles across an interval with recombination fraction r, so R(r)=1−∑ipii(n)⁠. The map expansion is dR/dr evaluated at r = 0 (see Teuscher and Broman 2007). Using Equation (2) above, we then get that the map expansion in this population is n(1−∑αi2)⁠. In the special case that αi≡1/k for all i, this reduces to n(k−1)/k⁠., The map expansion at generation s in DO mice on an autosome is (7/8)(s−1)+M1 where M1 is the weighted average of map expansion in the pre-CC founders (Broman 2012b), or about (7s+37)/8⁠. Equating this with (7/8)n⁠, we can thus take n≈s+5 when using this model to approximate the DO. For the CC, Broman (2005) showed that R = 7r/(1 + 6r), and so the map expansion is 7. Thus we can take n = 8 as the effective number of generations of random mating., We illustrate our approach with application to datasets on DO mice (Al-Barghouthi et al. 2021) and CC mice (Srivastava et al. 2017). In both cases, the approach provided results that were generally equivalent to those from the more exact model, though with important differences in the results for the X chromosome in the CC application., The DO mouse data of Al-Barghouthi et al. (2021) concerns a set of 619 mice from DO generations 23–33, in 11 batches by generation and including 304 females and 315 males. The mice were genotyped on the GigaMUGA array (Morgan et al. 2016) and the cleaned data consist of genotypes at 109,427 markers. A wide variety of phenotypes are available; we focus on the 20 contributing to the results in Table 1 of Al-Barghouthi et al. (2021)., We performed genotype reconstruction using the transition matrices derived specifically for DO mice (Broman et al. 2019b) as well as by the approximate model proposed above. For the DO mice at generation n, we used the transition probabilities for general eight-way AIL at n + 5., Following Al-Barghouthi et al. (2021), we assumed a 0.2% genotyping error rate and used the Carter–Falconer map function (Carter and Falconer 1951). Calculations were performed in R (R Core Team 2021) with R/qtl2 (Broman et al. 2019a), on an 8-core Linux laptop with 64 GB RAM. The calculations with the DO-specific model took approximately 35 min, while those with the general AIL model took 27 min, an almost 25% reduction in computation time., The transition probabilities used by the two models are only subtly different and become less different in later generations. The probability of an exchange across an interval on a random DO chromosome, as a function of the recombination fraction for the interval and the number of generations, is shown in Figure 2., Differences in transition probabilities for DO mice from more-exact calculations and the proposed approximations. Probability of an exchange of alleles across an interval as a function of generation with the more-exact calculations (solid lines) and the proposed approximation (dashed lines) for autosomes (A) and the X chromosome (B).

Ratio of the probabilities (more-exact vs approximation) for autosomes (C) and the X chromosome (D)., QTL analysis proceeded by the method described in Gatti et al. (2014) and also used by Al-Barghouthi et al. (2021). Namely, we fit a linear mixed model assuming an additive model for the founder haplotypes, with a residual polygenic effect to account for relationships among individuals with kinship matrices calculated using the “leave-one-chromosome-out” method (see Yang et al. 2014), and with a set of fixed-effect covariates defined in Al-Barghouthi et al. (2021)., The genotype probabilities were almost indistinguishable. The maximum difference was 0.011 on the X chromosome followed by a difference of 0.007 on chromosome 8. For that reason, the QTL mapping results were hardly different. Across all 20 traits considered, the maximum difference in LOD scores in the two sets of results was 0.02., The LOD curves by the two methods for tissue mineral density (TMD) and the differences between them are shown in Figure 3. The QTL on chromosomes 1 and 10 have LOD scores of 23.9 and 14.6, respectively, but the maximum difference in LOD, genome wide, between the two methods is just 0.014., Genome scan for TMD for the DO mouse data from Al-Barghouthi et al.

(A) LOD curves across the genome using the genotype probabilities from the DO-specific model (solid blue curves) and the proposed general model (dotted pink curves). (B) Differences between the two sets of LOD curves., As a second application of our approach, we consider the data for a set of 69 CC lines (Srivastava et al. 2017). These are eight-way RIL derived from the same eight founders as the DO mice, as the DO was formed from 144 partially inbred lines from the process of developing the CC (Svenson et al. 2012)., Each CC line was formed from a separate “funnel,” bringing the eight founder genomes together as rapidly as possible, for example [(A × B)×(C × D)]×[(E × F)×(G × H)], where the female parent is listed first in each cross. Inbreeding was accomplished by repeated mating between siblings., The recombination probabilities for the autosomes in the CC do not depend on the order of the founders in the funnel for a line (Broman 2005). This is in contrast with the case of eight-way RIL by selfing (see Broman 2005, Table 2). For the X chromosome, however, the cross order is important, as only five of the eight founders can contribute. For example, in a line derived from the cross [(A × B)×(C × D)]×[(E × F)×(G × H)], the single-locus genotype probabilities on the X chromosome are 1/6 each for alleles A, B, E, and F, and 1/3 for allele C, while alleles D, G, and H will be absent. And note that the mitochondrial DNA will come from founder A, while the Y chromosome will be from founder H., The cross funnel information was missing for 14 of the 69 CC lines. While the sources of the mitochondria and Y chromosome were provided for all lines, there were several inconsistencies in these data: line CC013/GeniUnc has the same founder listed as the source for its mitochondria and Y chromosome, and for three lines (CC031/GeniUnc, CC037/TauUnc, and CC056/GeniUnc) the founder on the Y chromosome is also seen contributing to the X chromosome. We used the genotype probabilities reported in Srivastava et al. (2017) to construct compatible cross funnels, with small modifications to handle the inconsistent information., We performed genotype reconstruction using the transition matrices derived specifically for CC mice (Broman 2005) as well as by the approximate model proposed above, using n = 8 generations of random mating, chosen to match the expected frequency of recombination breakpoints., The resulting probabilities were nearly identical on all autosomes in all CC lines. The maximum difference in probabilities on the autosomes was just 0.0006., There were some important differences on the X chromosome, however. There were no cases with high probability pointing to different founder alleles by the two models, but there were several cases where two or more founders cannot be distinguished, but some would be excluded by the assumed cross design., For example, in Figure 4, we show the genotype probabilities along the X chromosome for strain CC038/GeniUnc, as calculated with the more-exact model (Figure 4A) and with the approximate model (Figure 4B). We also include the results for the case that the more-exact model but when an incorrect cross design was used (Figure 4C). Note the segment near 135 Mbp, which is inferred to be from founder NOD with the more-exact model but is equally likely B6 or NOD with the approximate model; the B6 and NOD founder strains are identical in the region, but the assumed cross design for the CC038/GeniUnc strain excluded B6. For the results using the incorrect cross design (which excluded not just B6 but also 129 and NOD), the results across the entire chromosome become a chopped-up mess, with an apparent 39 recombination breakpoints, vs 5 when the correct cross information is used., Genotype probabilities along the X chromosome for CC strain CC038/GeniUnc.

(C) Results using the more-exact model but with the wrong cross information, excluding founders B6, 129, and NOD., Genotype probabilities along the X chromosome for CC strain CC038/GeniUnc. (A) Results using the more-exact model that excludes founders B6, CAST, and WSB. (B) Results using the proposed approximate model. (C) Results using the more-exact model but with the wrong cross information, excluding founders B6, 129, and NOD., Overall, there were seven strains where the maximum difference in the probabilities from the more-exact model and the proposed approximate model were in the range 0.25–0.50, and another eight strains with maximum difference in the range 0.10–0.25. All of the differences concern cases where multiple founders are identical for a region and either some would be excluded by the cross design, or where the difference in prior frequencies affects the results. For example, in the cross [(A × B)×(C × D)]×[(E × F)×(G × H)], the frequency of the C allele on the X chromosome is twice that of A, B, E, and F., We have proposed an approximate model for use with genotype reconstruction in MPPs. We derived the two-point probabilities on autosomes in the case of random mating in large, discrete generations, derived from a founder population of a set of inbred lines in known proportions. We use the same frequencies for the X chromosome, but with 2/3 the number of generations. The approach is shown to give equivalent results for the mouse DO and CC populations, though with important differences for the X chromosome in CC lines, where some founder alleles can be excluded based on the cross design. The more-exact model for the X chromosome in the CC excludes three of the eight founders based on the cross design. This is particularly useful in cases that multiple founders are identical by descent across a region. However, the approximate model is not affected by errors in the specified cross design (see Figure 4)., The value of this generic model points toward the general usefulness of the original software for MPPs, HAPPY (Mott et al. 2000), developed for the analysis of mouse HS. The results may depend on marker density and informativeness, but with a dense set of informative markers, a generic approach can provide good-quality genome reconstructions., The HMM itself is an approximation. Meiosis generally exhibits positive crossover interference, but the Markov property is closer to being correct in MPPs with multiple generations of mating, because nearby recombination events come from independent generations. This was apparent in the three-point probabilities derived by Haldane and Waddington (1931) for two-way RIL and was further explored in Broman (2005) for multiway RIL., The proposed method has been implemented in the R/qtl2 software (Broman et al. 2019a). It requires specification of the founder proportions and one other parameter (the number of generations of random mating) which governs the frequency of recombination breakpoints. The founder proportions should be straightforward from the cross design; the effective number of generations of random mating may require some calibration, such as through computer simulation to match the expected frequency of recombination breakpoints., The R/qtl2 software is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), https://cran.r-project.org/package=qtl2, as well as GitHub, https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2.
